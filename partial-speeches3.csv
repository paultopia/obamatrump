THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary  _______________________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                                                             August 15, 2009 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT  IN TOWN HALL ON HEALTH CARE Central High school  Grand Junction, Colorado 3:44 P.M. MDT THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello, Grand Junction!  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Everybody please have a seat.  It is good to be back in Southwest Colorado.  (Applause.)  Last time I was here I had some really good peaches.  (Laughter.)  Somehow, though, Michelle and the girls got to go pick peaches -- and I'm hoping they bring some back for me. It is nice to take a break from the back and forth in Washington.  I want to especially want to thank Nathan for his introduction and sharing his story.  (Applause.)  It's not easy to talk about an illness in the family.  It's not easy to talk about such a painful experience.  Because it's important that we understand what's at stake in this health care debate he's been willing to share it with us.  And so I'm very grateful to him. We've got a couple of other special guests that I want to acknowledge.  First of all, I stole him from you to make him what I believe will be the best Secretary of the Interior in the history of the United States, Ken Salazar.  (Applause.)  But I left things in good hands with the outstanding congressman and brother of Ken, John Salazar.  (Applause.) Your outstanding governor of this great state, Bill Ritter, is here.  (Applause.)  As well as the extraordinary First Lady of the state, Jeannie Ritter is here as well.  (Applause.) Two of the finest young senators that we've got in Washington right now:  Senator Mark Udall.  (Applause.)  And Senator Michael Bennet.  (Applause.) I want to thank the hospitality of Grand Junction Mayor Bruce Hill.  (Applause.)  And finally I want to thank Tillie Bishop for the invocation.  (Applause.)  And I want to thank the Central High students Elise Beckstead, Crystal Rossman, Axel Urie and Amelia LyBarger for their National Anthem and Pledge of Allegiance.  Thank you, guys.  (Applause.) Oh, and Central High principal Jody Diers is here.  (Applause.)  And it turns out school starts in two days.  (Laughter.)  You know, when I was going to school we always had until Labor Day.  (Laughter.)  It's rough for kids these days.  But it's important for us to be able to compete internationally, so it's great to see dedicated educators like we have here at Central High.  (Applause.) You know, Nathan's story is the kind of story that I've read in letters and heard in town halls all across America.  And on Tuesday I was in New Hampshire talking about people denied coverage because of preexisting conditions.  Yesterday, I was in Montana talking about people who've had their insurance policies suddenly revoked, even though they were paying their premiums, just because they got sick.  Today we're talking about people like Nathan and his family who have insurance but are still stuck with huge bills because they've hit a cap on their benefits or they're charged exorbitant out-of-pocket fees. And when you hear about these experiences, when you think about the millions of people denied coverage because of preexisting conditions and the thousands who have their policies cancelled because of an illness, the countless people like Nathan, I want you to remember one thing:  There but for the grace of God go I.  (Applause.)  This is something that sometimes we've forgotten during the course of this health care debate.  These are ordinary Americans.  They're no different from anybody else.  They're working hard, they're meeting their responsibilities, but they're held hostage by health insurance companies that deny them coverage, or drop their coverage, or charge fees that they can't afford for care that they desperately need. It's hurting too many families and businesses.  It's wrong.  And we're going to fix it when we pass health insurance reform this year.  (Applause.) Now, this is obviously a tough time for the families in Colorado and all across America.  I just want to rewind the clock a little bit, because sometimes people have forgotten what's transpired over the last seven, eight months.  Just six months ago, we were in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes.  We were losing about 700,000 jobs each month.  Economists from the left and the right, liberals and conservatives, feared the second coming of the Great Depression.  I don't know if everybody remembers that.  That was six months ago.  That's why we acted as fast as we could to pass a recovery plan to stop the freefall.  And there's been a lot of misinformation about that, so let me just talk briefly about what it is that we did. The recovery plan was divided into three parts.  One-third of the money -- one-third of the money in the Recovery Act, the stimulus plan -- went to tax cuts that are already showing up in the paychecks of nearly 2 million working families in Colorado, including right here in Grand Junction.  (Applause.)  So I just want everybody to be clear:  One-third of it, tax cuts -- not tax increases -- more money in your pockets to spend as you wish. We also cut taxes for small businesses on the investments that they make, and hundreds of Colorado small businesses have qualified for new loans backed by the Recovery Act -- including 11 businesses in Grand Junction alone.  (Applause.) So that was one-third of it. Now, another third of the money in the Recovery Act is for emergency relief for folks who've borne the brunt of this recession.  So we've extended unemployment benefits for more than 150,000 Colorado citizens.  (Applause.)  We've made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who are having to use COBRA because they lost their jobs and they're out there looking for work.  (Applause.)  And for states facing historic budget shortfalls, we provided assistance that has saved the jobs of tens of thousands of workers who provide essential services, like teachers and police officers.  And Governor Ritter will tell you, if we had not had some of that money in, then Colorado would have had to make much more painful job cuts in vital services and might have had to put in place some very painful state and local tax increases.  So that was the second third of the Recovery Act. Now, the last third of the Recovery Act is for investments that are already putting people back to work.  There are almost 100 shovel-ready transportation projects already approved in Colorado which are beginning to create jobs.  Not far from here, for example, there's a project to pave and add lanes to State Highway 92.  Most of the work is being done by local businesses, because that's how we're going to create jobs and grow this economy again. And by next month, projects will be underway at more than 100 national parks all over America, including Colorado.  (Applause.)  Now these are -- these are projects restoring trails, improving infrastructure, making park facilities more energy efficient.  Earlier today, some of you may know, I toured Yellowstone with Michelle and the girls.  We saw Old Faithful -- I hadn't seen it since I was 11 years old.  It's still going strong.  (Laughter.)  Tomorrow we're going to be visiting the Grand Canyon. And I recently signed into law a public lands bill that designates the Dominguez-Escalante Canyon as a National Conservation Area here in Colorado.  (Applause.)  These are national treasures -- symbols of how much we owe to those who came before us, and the fact that we're borrowing this earth from those who will follow us.  And I want to thank especially Ken Salazar, because he's been leading the way on these vital issues, especially in the West.  (Applause.) As we grapple with enormous challenges -- like health care -- the work of generations past reminds us of our duty to generations yet to come. So there is no doubt that the recovery plan is doing what we said it would:  putting us on the road to recovery.  It's not solving all problems.  Unemployment is still way too high.  But we just saw last week that the jobs picture is beginning to turn.  We're starting to see signs that business investment is coming back.  But that doesn't mean we're out of the woods.  Even before this extraordinary financial crisis we had an economy that was working pretty well for the wealthiest Americans -- working pretty well for Wall Street bankers, for big corporations -- but it wasn't working so well for everybody else.  It was an economy of bubbles and busts.  It was an economy in which the average worker, their wages and incomes had flatlined for a decade.  It was an economy that rewarded recklessness over responsibility.  So we can't go back to that kind of economy. If we want this country to succeed in the 21st century, we've got to lay a new foundation for lasting prosperity.  And health insurance reform is a key pillar of this new foundation.  (Applause.)  Because this economy -- this economy won't work for everyone until folks like Nathan and his family aren't pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by medical expenses; until companies aren't slashing payrolls and losing profits to pay for health insurance; until every single American has the security and peace of mind of quality, affordable health care. And health care touches us all in profound ways -- which by the way means that it's only natural this debate is going to be an emotional one.  There's a lot at stake.  And I know there's been a lot of attention paid to some of the town hall meetings that are going on around the country -- especially those where tempers have flared, and TV really likes that.  You can have 20 really great town hall meetings, and if there's one where somebody loses their temper, that's the one TV wants to cover. What you haven't been seeing are the constructive meetings going on all over the country.  That doesn't mean people agree with me on every single issue, but it means that we've been trying to figure out how do we solve what we know is an unsustainable problem in our health care system.  (Applause.) So just yesterday -- just yesterday I held a town hall in Belgrade, Montana, and we had a pretty good crowd.  Some were big supporters of reform.  Some had concerns and questions.  Some were completely skeptical.  And I got tough questions.  But even though Montanans have strong opinions, they didn't shout at one another.  They were there to listen.  And that reflects the American people and what our democracy is about, a lot more than what's been covered on TV these last few days.  And that's why I thank all of you, whether you're for or against health care reform, for being here today.  (Applause.) Now, I'm going to take a bunch of questions, but before I do, I want to just talk about what health insurance reform will mean for you, because there's a lot of misunderstandings out there. First of all, what we're proposing is a common-sense set of consumer protections for people with health insurance, people with private insurance.  I expect that after reform passes, the vast majority of Americans are still going to be getting their insurance from private insurers.  So we've got to have some protections in place for people like Nathan, people like you. So insurance companies will no longer be able to place an arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive or charge outrageous out-of-pocket expenses on top of your premiums.  That's what happened to Nathan and his wife.  Their son was diagnosed with hemophilia when he was born.  The insurance company then raised the premiums for his family and for all his coworkers who were on the same policy.  The family was approaching their cap. And so on top of worrying about taking care of their son, they had the added worry of trying to find insurance that would cover him -- plus thousands and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs.  Nathan and his wife even considered getting a divorce so that she might possibly go on Medicaid. Now thankfully, Colorado's law doesn't allow coverage for small businesses to permanently exclude preexisting conditions like his son's, so eventually they found insurance.  But they're paying increasing premiums and they still have to face the prospect of hitting their new cap in the next few years. Those are the stories I hear all over the country.  I heard from a teenager in Indiana diagnosed with leukemia.  The chemotherapy and intensive care he received cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  His family hit their lifetime cap in less than a year.  They had insurance.  So the insurance wouldn't cover a bone marrow transplant and the family couldn't afford all the money that was needed.  The family turned to the public for help, but the boy died before he could receive that transplant. If you think that can't happen to you or your family, think again.  Almost 90 percent of individual health insurance policies have lifetime benefit limits.  And about a third of family plans in the individual insurance market have lifetime limits under $3 million.  If you or your spouse or your child gets sick and you hit that limit, it's suddenly like you have no insurance at all. And this is part of a larger story, of folks with insurance, paying more and more out of pocket.  In the past few years, premiums have nearly doubled for the average American family.  Total out-of-pocket costs have increased by almost 50 percent -- that's more than $2,000 per person.  And nobody is holding these insurance companies accountable for these practices.  And by the way, your employer is paying even more, and you may not even see the costs of it except for the fact that's why you're not getting a raise -- (applause) -- because it's going into your health care instead of your salary and income. So we're going to ban arbitrary caps on benefits.  We'll place limits on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses.  No one in America should go broke because they get sick.  (Applause.) Now, insurance companies will also be stopped from cancelling your coverage because you get sick or denying coverage because of your medical history.  (Applause.)  Again, if you think this has nothing to do with you, think again.  A recent report found that in the past few years, more than 12 million Americans were discriminated against by insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.  When we get health insurance reform, those days will be over.  And we will require insurance companies to cover routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies.  That saves money; it saves lives.  (Applause.) At the same time -- I just want to be completely clear about this; I keep on saying this but somehow folks aren't listening -- if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan.  Nobody is going to force you to leave your health care plan.  If you like your doctor, you keep seeing your doctor.  I don't want government bureaucrats meddling in your health care.  But the point is, I don't want insurance company bureaucrats meddling in your health care either.  (Applause.) So just to recap here, if you're one of nearly 46 million people who don't have health insurance, you will finally have quality, affordable options.  If you do have health insurance, we will help make that insurance more affordable and more secure.  Under the reform proposals that we've put out there, roughly 700,000 middle-class Coloradans will get a health care tax credit.  More than a million Coloradans will have access to a new marketplace where you can easily compare health insurance options; 87,000 small businesses in Colorado will be aided by new tax benefits, so when they're doing the right thing for their employees, they're not penalized for it.  (Applause.)  And we will do all of this without adding to our deficit over the next decade, largely by cutting waste and ending sweetheart deals for insurance companies that don't make anybody any healthier.  (Applause.) Now here -- if you don't -- I know there's some skepticism:  Well, how are you going to save money in the health care system?  You're doing it here in Grand Junction.  (Applause.)  You know -- you know that lowering costs is possible if you put in place smarter incentives; if you think about how to treat people, not just illnesses; if you look at problems facing not just one hospital or physician, but the many system-wide problems that are shared.  That's what the medical community in this city did, and now you're getting better results while wasting less money.  And I know that your senator, Michael Bennet, has been working hard on legislation that's based on putting the innovations that are here in Grand Junction into practice across the system, and there's no reason why we can't do that.  (Applause.) So the fact is, we are closer to achieving reform than we've ever been.  We have the American Nurses Association, we have the American Medical Association on board, because America's doctors and nurses know how badly we need reform.  (Applause.)  We have -- we have broad agreement in Congress on about 80 percent of what we're trying to achieve.  We have an agreement from drug companies to make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors -- $80 billion that can cut the doughnut hole that seniors have to deal with on prescription drug plans in half.  (Applause.)  The AARP supports this policy, and agrees with us that reform must happen this year. But look, because we're getting close, the fight is getting fierce.  And the history is clear:  Every time we're in sight of reform, the special interests start fighting back with everything they've got.  They use their influence.  They run their ads.  And let's face it, they get people scared.  And understandably -- I understand why people are nervous.  Health care is a big deal.  In fact, whenever America has set about solving our toughest problems, there have always been those who've sought to preserve the status quo by scaring the American people. That's what happened when FDR tried to pass Social Security -- they said that was socialist.  They did -- verbatim.  That's what they said.  They said that everybody was going to have to wear dog tags and that this was a plot for the government to keep track of everybody.  When JFK and then Lyndon Johnson tried to pass Medicare, they said this was a government takeover of health care; they were going to get between you and your doctor -- the same argument that's being made today. These struggles have always boiled down to a contest between hope and fear.  It was true when Social Security was born.  It was true when Medicare was created.  It's true in today's debate.  (Applause.) But whether you have health insurance or you don't have health insurance, we all know we can't continue down this path.  Costs are rising far faster than wages.  Cuts -- the system works a lot better for insurance companies than it does for America's families.  To maintain what's best about our health care system, for you to keep what you've got if you're happy with it, is going to require change. We've got to keep what's good about the system, especially the relationship between doctors, nurses, and their patients, while fixing what's broken -- because for all the scare tactics out there, what's truly scary is if we don't do anything.  We will continue to see 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every day.  Premiums will continue to skyrocket, going up three times faster than your wages.  The deficit will continue to grow because most of it is Medicare and Medicaid.  Medicare will go into the red in less than a decade.  And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against people just because they're sick. So if you want a different future -- a brighter future -- I need your help.  (Applause.)  I need you to stand for hope.  I need you to knock on doors.  I need you to spread the word, because we are going to get this done this year.  Thank you, Grand Junction.  Thank you.  (Applause.) Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Now, I've got time for a bunch of questions.  We've got a bunch of people in the audience with microphones.  Hold up your microphones, guys.  All right.  Now, the way we're going to do this is, I'm just going to go around the room.  Raise your hand.  To be fair I'm going to make sure it's girl, boy, girl, boy.  (Laughter.)  If you can introduce yourself and ask your question or make your comment, if you can keep your question or comment relatively brief, I will try to keep my answers relatively brief, and that way we can make sure that we get through more questions during the course of this event.  All right?  Okay.  Let's see hands.  And I'll start with this young lady right here in the pink blouse.  Oops, hold on, the mic doesn't -- can you check that mic?  Is it working?  Does it work? Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President.  My name is Polly.  I work at Rocky Mountain Orthopedics here in Grand Junction.  On behalf of our CEO, I would like to extend an invitation for you to visit our successful practice to see how we provide excellent health care at a lower average cost to our patients. My question is, the original health care House bill included funding for federally qualified health centers whose future budget would be based on expenses plus inflation.  If private physicians, hospitals, and other providers are going to be given incentives to reduce waste and cost, what will be done to ensure the government programs will do the same? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it's an excellent question.  Part of what's so important about reform is that right now the way Medicare and Medicaid operates, if it's starting to go over budget, we basically have two choices.  Either we raise taxes and just keep on paying more and more, and health care inflation is going up at least twice as fast as inflation on everything else, or what we do is we just tell the providers, we're going to give you less money -- period.  We'll reimburse you 80 cents or 90 cents for every dollar of services that you provide.  And then what happens is that the providers, they end up just charging people with private insurance to make up for the difference.  So that drives everybody's costs up. Now what's been done here in Grand Junction, in other outstanding health programs like Mayo, is they started to change the delivery system so that you're actually getting more bang for your health care dollar. Let me give you an example.  Right now if you go to your doctor and you get a test, a lot of times that test won't be forwarded to the next doctor or specialist that you have to see.  You have to take another test.  You might have to take three or four or five tests by the time your treatment is all completed.  That's a waste of money.  And if we can incentivize the provider to say, do one test and then e-mail the results to everybody who might be providing treatment, or the patient might be referred to, that right there saves a lot of money. So what we want to do is to do this in Medicare and Medicaid, which will incentivize a lot of health systems around the country to start using some of the smart practices that you're using.  Frankly, Medicare and Medicaid is -- they provide a lot of care for a lot of patients, particularly seniors, and so if they hear from Medicare, can you start doing things smarter, they have an incentive to do it, and once they put a smarter system in place, the benefits spill over to the private insurance market, as well.  So we want to do it through Medicare and Medicaid, but we also want to see in the private insurance market that health providers start thinking smarter and providing better care, which often turns out to be lower-cost care. Now, it's not going to happen overnight, because a lot of these systems have been put in place for a long time.  And if you're in Grand Junction or Mayo Clinic or Geisinger or other of these really good health care systems, what they've done is each year they are continually comparing notes, they've got a peer review process where doctors are exchanging ideas, and they're continually making the system better and better, smarter and smarter, and over time what we can do is bend the cost curve so that instead of having inflation go up a lot faster on health care than everything else, it matches everything else. And if we could do that, if we could just get health care inflation to match the inflation on food and other items, all of our deficit -- long-term deficit problems would be solved.  Just that alone.  If we could just reduce the amount of health care inflation, our long-term debt and deficit problems would be solved. So this is the most important thing we can do for deficit reduction.  And I want everybody to remember that, because in this debate you've heard a lot of people saying, ""We can't afford to do this because our deficit and debt are too high.""  The biggest driver of our deficit and debt is health care.  And if we don't change delivery systems and adapt some of the innovations that are being used where you work and in really good health care systems around the country, then we're going to be in red ink forever. Okay.  Thank you so much for the question.  (Applause.) All right.  Gentleman in the red shirt back there.  Wait for the mic so everybody can hear you. Q    Thank you, Mr. President, for taking my question, for one.  I've got a bunch, but -- my name is Randy Piper (phonetic) and I have been in the health insurance business for over 25 years.  I'm also a big Steelers fan, as well. THE PRESIDENT:  I like that in you.  (Applause.)  Are you allowed to confess that though here, where -- (laughter.) Q    I can take it.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  All right, all right.  Go ahead. Q    You have asked many times why insurance companies are so afraid of competing with a public plan option of coverage.  And I understand insurance companies need to get spanked every now and again for sure, but if the public plan option reimburses on average 55 cents by contract of every dollar of care to the provider, and the private insurance plans by contract reimburse an average of 85 cents per dollar of care, how can it be considered fair competition?  And thank you for being here today.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think it's a good question.  Thank you.  For those of you who have not been following the debate as closely, let me just describe what this issue of the public plan is all about.  And to do so, I've got to describe how we're looking to provide health insurance for people who currently don't have it.  I spent most of my time talking about what we would do for folks who have health insurance, but we've still got 46 million uninsured and I think it is the right thing to provide them with some help.  Most of them work.  Most of them are responsible.  But their employer -- maybe they work for a small business -- their employer just can't afford it because they don't have the bargaining power to get low enough rates to cover all their employees.  That's a big category of the uninsured. So what we've said is, let's set up what's called a health insurance exchange.  It's essentially a marketplace where you could go online and you'd have a menu of options, most of them private insurers -- Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield -- insurance companies that wanted to participate, and they would list a range of plans just like when Mike and Mark want to get health insurance as members of the Senate, they go on to this exchange for federal health care -- for federal employees, and they select which plan works best for their families. So we want everybody to be able to access that and choose which plan works best for them.  And if they can't afford it, even though we'd have a lot of bargaining power, we'd be able to get the same kinds of rates that really big companies are able to get or the federal system is able to get, some people will still not be able to afford it, and then we would provide some subsidies.  And there would be certain rules governing any insurance company that's participating:  You couldn't exclude for preexisting conditions; you couldn't have a lifetime cap; you'd have to limit out-of-pocket expenses.  So all the insurance rules that I talked about, that would be part of the deal if you as an insurer wanted to sell insurance through this exchange. So far, so good.  The argument around public option is, should one of the choices -- not the only choice -- but one of the choices on that exchange be a public option?  And the idea here would be that a government-run non-for-profit would have its own option that people could sign up for -- they wouldn't have to, but they could sign up for it -- and if it could keep its costs lower and provide a good-quality service and good benefits, then that would help keep the insurance companies honest -- (applause) -- because the idea being -- the idea being that as a non-for-profit, potentially with lower administrative costs, they could do a good job. Now, the insurance companies have come back and said, well, that's not fair, because nobody can compete against the government.  They have a legitimate point if, if what's being done is the government is either subsidizing that government plan -- essentially taking taxpayer money and saying, here, we'll just keep on spending money regardless of whether you run a good operation or not, then it's hard for insurance companies to compete against that.  And by the way, it would be wildly expensive for taxpayers. So I've already said a public option can only work if they have to collect premiums just like a private insurer and compete on a level playing field.  That's point number one. The second argument that's been made is the one that you just made, which is, if public option is reimbursing at Medicaid rates that are substantially lower than what private insurers have to negotiate for, then eventually, over time, private insurers might be run out of business.  So that's the second argument. Now, what's happened in the House bill, that as it's been modified, is they've actually said we're going to negotiate rates, they won't be Medicaid rates.  So that actually solves the problem that you're addressing, because now this would be a negotiated process and prices would not be set just to Medicaid.  All right? Now, there's a third argument against the public option, and this is the one, really, that you've been hearing mostly about, and that is just this idea that we shouldn't have government involved at all, that government is part of the problem, not part of the solution, to quote Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.)  We've got some supporters of that view.  And I guess the only -- look, I think you can have a legitimate position just saying you don't want to see more government involvement.  I understand the argument.  The only thing I would point out is, is that Medicare is a government program that works really well for our seniors and has protected people -- (applause) -- hold on one second, let's not start yelling. It's true that it's expensive, but the truth is that actually the cost of Medicare inflation has actually gone up at a slower rate than private insurance.  So it's not because it's mismanaged; it's because of what was referred to in the first question -- the whole health care system is out of whack and way too expensive.  It's not government, per se.  It has to do with the fact that the health care system itself, the delivery systems, are not working the way they should. So if you just believe the government shouldn't be involved in anything, or shouldn't be involved in health care, period, then you're right that you can't support the kind of reform that we're proposing.  The only thing I want to make sure of, though, is you've got to -- you make an honest argument, because nobody is talking about government takeover of health care.  There's a difference between what we're proposing, which has some government involvement, versus this idea that somehow government is going to take over everything and get between your and doctor.  That's not what we're proposing. So we can have an honest disagreement, but I just want to be clear on what the debate is about.  It's about this narrow issue of the public plan.  It's not about somehow eliminating private insurance.  Everybody who has currently private insurance that works for them will be able to keep private insurance under the proposals that have been made in Congress.  All right?  (Applause.) Okay, it's a woman's turn.  It's a young lady's turn.  Let me -- right there with the vest.  Yes, that's you.  (Laughter.) Q    Hello, Mr. President, and thanks for being here. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Q    My name is Jamie and I am a nursing student at Mesa State.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Outstanding. Q    Being as I am a potential health care provider in the health care system, there are a few things in the plan that I read about that I wanted to understand more -- THE PRESIDENT:  Sure. Q    -- as far as providers being required to report -- what was the words -- preventable medical errors in the health care system.  Now, as far as health care systems are concerned, we are required to report every error we see.  So I kind of want a clarification of how much you're expecting from providers in this system. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, different states have different rules.  So we got kind of a patchwork.  I don't -- I confess I don't know exactly what the rules are here in Colorado.  But about 100,000 people die every year from preventable diseases and illnesses in hospitals.  Some of the ways that we could solve this are so simple.  There's actually a doctor who's put together a protocol -- washing your hands, a lot of just basic stuff that costs no money -- that has been shown repeatedly to cut these preventable illnesses and deaths down drastically -- by a magnitude of 50 percent, 75 percent reductions in preventable deaths just by applying these things that don't cost any money. So the question then becomes, how do we get more hospitals, more doctors, more health systems, to adopt these systems.  And the best way to do it is to make sure that not only are they reporting these preventable errors, but that they're also available to consumers -- the American people -- so that if they've got too many of them, after a while they start getting embarrassed.  Right?  I mean, if you found out that there are two hospitals here in this city and one hospital has half the preventable deaths of the other hospital, you'd want to know that, wouldn't you? The problem is right now oftentimes it's very hard for consumers to get that information directly.  So the idea is simply to make sure that that information is packaged in a way where you can comparison shop, and your employer -- if you're getting health insurance from your employer -- could comparison shop.  So we're putting some competitive pressure to improve quality across the system.  That's what we're talking about.  (Applause.) By the way, thank you for being a nurse, because we need more nurses.  That's important.  (Applause.) All right, gentleman right here in the t-shirt.  Hold on one second, we got a mic coming. Q    Thank you for coming to Colorado.  It's a great place. THE PRESIDENT:  It's a great place.  (Applause.) Q    You touched on this.  I would like you to expand a little more.  This problem with misinformation in our country, it seems to me that it's not only just hurting health care reform, health insurance reform, it's dividing our country.  (Applause.)  Is it not maybe time -- I think we all know where it's coming from.  Is it not time that something can be done -- okay, I got to watch what I'm saying, but -- THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, let me -- let me just -- let me address this.  You know, health care is really hard.  I mean, this is not easy.  I'm a reasonably dedicated student to this issue.  I've got a lot of really smart people around me who have been working on this for months now.  We've got really fine public servants like Senators Bennet and Udall who are working on this and thinking about it a lot. And the truth is -- I want to be completely honest here -- there is no perfect, painless silver bullet out there that solves every problem, gives everybody perfect health care for free.  There isn't.  I wish there was.  I wish I could just say, you know what, we're going to change the system, everybody will get as much care as they want any time they want, everybody will have it, and it won't cost anything.  And doctors will be happy and nurses will be happy, hospitals will be happy, insurance companies will still make a lot of profits, drug companies will be able to charge as much as they want.  I can't do it.  Nobody can. What I can do is try to sort through what are all the options available, be realistic about where we're going on health care, say to myself, if we keep on doing what we're doing, we are in a world of hurt.  We can't afford what we're doing right now.  More people are going to lose health insurance.  More employers are going to drop coverage or push more coverage onto their employees with higher premiums and higher deductibles.  Medicare and Medicaid will go broke.  State budgets and federal budgets will be unsustainable. And then we're going to have to make some really bad decisions where we had no good options -- even worse options than we have right now.  And what's going to end up happening is -- mark my words -- if we do nothing, at some point Medicare in about eight to nine years goes into the red.  Somebody mentioned it's going broke -- yes, it is going broke. So here's what's going to happen if we don't change the delivery systems and change some of the incentives -- we'll have a choice.  We'll either have to cut Medicare, in which case seniors then will bear the brunt of it, or we'll have to raise taxes, which nobody likes.  And we still will be paying about $5,000 to $6,000 more than any other advanced country in the world and not get better health care for it.  Now that doesn't make sense. So in terms of misinformation, there is -- because there's no perfect solution, we can have legitimate debates about the public option that we just had.  That was a good, serious debate, and you can make a plausible argument as to why we shouldn't have a public option.  Now, I believe that we should on balance.  It's not perfect.  It's not going to solve every problem, but I think it actually would keep the insurance companies more honest.  You can have a honest disagreement with me on that. What you can't do -- or you can, but you shouldn't do -- is start saying things like, we want to set up death panels to pull the plug on grandma.  I mean, come on.  (Applause.)  I mean, I just -- first of all, when you make a comment like that -- I just lost my grandmother last year.  I know what it's like to watch somebody you love, who's aging, deteriorate, and have to struggle with that.  So the notion that somehow I ran for public office, or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma?  I mean, when you start making arguments like that, that's simply dishonest, especially when I hear the arguments coming from members of Congress in the other party who, turns out, sponsored similar provisions. Here's what this was about.  Here was the genesis of this little piece of information.  We had a provision in the House bill that would give the option -- the option -- of somebody getting counseling on end-of-life care or hospice care, and have it reimbursed by Medicare; the option -- voluntary -- so you'd have more information about how to deal with these situations. Turns out the biggest proponent of this was a Republican congressman who is now a senator and a colleague of Mr. Udall and Mr. Bennet.  Turns out in Medicare Part D, which was passed by a Republican Congress, they had the exact same provision. So when I have people who just a couple of years ago thought this was a good idea now getting on television suggesting that it's a plot against grandma or to sneak euthanasia into our health care system, that feels dishonest to me.  And we've got enough stuff to deal with without having these kinds of arguments.  (Applause.) All right, so it's -- all right, it's a woman's turn here.  Yes, I sort of neglected this area right here.  Young lady right there, blond hair, black blouse -- white dress.  Yes, right there.  Go ahead. Q    Hi, my name is Julie, and I'm a small business owner from Colorado Springs.  I am also a Republican that voted for you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Q    You're welcome.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  What's your business? Q    We make software. THE PRESIDENT:  Excellent.  We need that. Q    I hope so.  (Laughter.)  So I grew up in a blue-collar family, and my husband and I work very hard at our small business.  We've always treated our employees like family, given them great benefits, any time off they need with their family.  I volunteer in my professional community.  I volunteer at my children's schools.  And that's still not enough, because us small business owners that are on that cusp between middle class and the rich are going to bear the brunt of a lot of what this is going to cost.  Why is what I do now not enough?  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Let me -- I think it's a good question.  Let me talk about both cost and what this would mean for small businesses, because both issues would affect you. First of all, remember what I said, I can't come up with a perfect solution that is completely free.  It is absolutely true that in order for us to provide help to those who have no insurance at all, that's going to cost some money.  It's going to cost some money.  We can't do it for free.  They've got no health insurance right now; we're going to help them.  It's 46 million people.  That's going to cost some money. Now, what I've proposed is going to cost roughly $900 billion -- $800 billion to $900 billion.  That's a lot of money.  Keep in mind it's over 10 years.  So when you hear some of these figures thrown out there, this is not per year, this is over 10 years.  So let's assume it's about $80 billion a year.  It turns out that about two-thirds of that could be paid for by eliminating waste in the existing system. So I'll give you -- let me give you one particular example.  We right now provide $177 billion over 10 years -- or about $17 billion, $18 billion a year -- to insurance companies in the forms of subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage where they basically run the Medicare program that everybody else has, except they get an extra bunch of money that they make a big profit off of.  And there's no proof, no evidence at all that seniors are better off using Medicare Advantage than regular Medicare.  If we could save that $18 billion a year, that is money that we can use to help people who right now need some help. So about two-thirds of what we're talking about is paid for through the existing health care system, money that's already being paid by taxpayers -- does not require additional taxes.  But that still leaves one-third. Now, in order to pay for that, there have been a lot of proposals out there.  One of them that I proposed, I still think is the best idea.  You may disagree, because I don't know what your income bracket is.  My proposal was that for people making more than $250,000 a year -- people like myself -- that we should, instead of getting the full itemized deduction of what our highest tax bracket is, we should just cap out our itemized deduction at 28 percent, which is what the average American gets.  So -- because my attitude is, I shouldn't get a bigger tax break if I write a check to my local church than if the janitor down the street writes a check to their local church.  We should get the same tax break.  If we were willing to do that, just that alone would pay for what we're talking about.  (Applause.) Now, some members of Congress disagree with that and they've got other proposals, and that's going to be worked out in September. I do want to make the point, though, that I have not proposed any plan that would put the burden on middle-class families in order to deal with this.  So when you hear people talking about I'm raising your taxes, the only tax policies I've implemented for middle-class families is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families. Now, let me talk about small businesses.  I don't know your particular situation, whether you're providing health insurance right now to your employees.  If you are, then you stand to benefit from this plan because every proposal, both in the House and the Senate, that's been put forward, provides a huge number of subsidies to small business owners that are doing the right thing by their employees.  (Applause.) So it is very likely -- you know, obviously we'd have to look at the calculation; I'd have to figure out how many employees you have, what kind of health insurance plan you had, et cetera -- but it is very likely that you would actually make money, gain from this plan, because you're already providing health insurance to your employees and we would give you some help. The only category of folks who might not like this plan are employers who can afford to provide health insurance to their employees but aren't doing so, because what we would then say to them, what we'd say to them is, look, we're giving you affordable options; you are going to be able now to be part of a bigger pool.  You can buy your health insurance through that exchange that I was explaining to that gentleman there.  So you'll be able to get premiums and prices that are comparable to what big companies, Xerox or IBM, are getting for their employees, and we'll give you some help doing it. But if you refuse to provide any health insurance for your employees at all, then we are going to ask you to make a contribution to help make sure those employees have health insurance, because by the way, it turns out if you as an employer are not providing that health insurance, the rest of us are, because those folks are going on Medicaid, or they're going to the hospitals for uncompensated care, and that's not fair.  (Applause.) So the bottom line is this:  If you are a small business person who is providing health insurance for your employees, I am very sure that you would actually benefit from this.  But the problem is -- again, this is where the information has not been going out in as clear a fashion as possible, which is why I'm glad you asked the question. All right?  Okay.  (Applause.) All right, I'm going to call on this gentleman because he's been waving -- and he's shouted at me a couple of times, so I just want to -- I just want proof here that I'm happy to get a good debate going.  Q    How are you doing, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT:  I'm good.  What's your name? Q    My name is Zack Lane (phonetic).  I'm a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder. THE PRESIDENT:  Good to talk to you, Zack.  What do you study? Q    Political science and business marketing. THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  All right, what's your question? Q    My question is this.  And also, I'd love to have a debate, just all out, anytime, Oxford-style, if you'd like.  (Laughter.)  I understand -- I'm willing to do that.  But my question is this.  We all know the best way to reduce prices in this economy is to increase competition.  How in the world can a private corporation providing insurance compete with an entity that does not have to worry about making a profit, does not have to pay local property taxes -- (applause) -- they do not have to -- they're not subject to local regulations?  How can a company compete with that?  And I'm not looking for anything -- I don't want generalities.  I don't want philosophical arguments.  I'm just asking a question. THE PRESIDENT:  That's a great question.  Thank you for the question.  (Applause.) Now, I just want to point out that I partially answered the question earlier by explaining that certainly they can't compete if the taxpayer is standing behind the public option just shoveling more and more money at it, right?  That's certainly not fair.  And so I've already said I would not be in favor of a public option of that sort because that would just mean more expenses out of our pockets and we wouldn't be seeing much improvement in quality. It is true that there are certain costs associated with a private business that a government would not have to worry about; you mentioned a couple of them.  It's not just, by the way, property taxes; it's also things like just the cost of capital.  In terms of the cost of borrowing, a public option -- insurance companies have to have a lot of money on hand and it's conceivable that a private entity that's having to pay a certain interest rate for their money would be really undermined if the government is able to get money much cheaper implicitly because Uncle Sam backs this operation. So that's why I say, this is actually a legitimate debate.  I think that we can craft a system in which you've got a public option that has to operate independently, not subsidized by taxpayers -- it would be nonprofit, but we've already got nonprofits out there like BlueCross BlueShield -- that they would have to go on the market and get a market price for capital, so they wouldn't be able to just have the Federal Reserve write them a check.  I think there are ways that we can address those competitive issues.  And you're absolutely right, if they're not entirely addressed, then that raises a set of legitimate problems. But the only point I wanted to make was the notion that somehow just by having a public option you have the entire private marketplace destroyed is just not borne out by the facts.  And in fact, right now you've got a lot of private companies who do very well competing against the government.  UPS and FedEx are doing a lot better than the post office.  (Applause.)  No, they are.  And so -- but the larger point I want to make -- and it's good to see a young person who's very engaged and confident challenging the President to a Oxford-style debate, I think this is good.  (Applause.)  You know, the -- this is good.  You know, I like that.  You got to have a little chutzpah, you know. This is a legitimate debate to have.  All I'm saying is, though, that the public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform.  This is just one sliver of it, one aspect of it.  And by the way, it's both the right and the left that have become so fixated on this that they forget everything else, like the fact that we can help Nathan make sure that he doesn't suddenly find himself -- (applause) -- completely broke in trying to treat his son. So we are working on a series of proposals to address the questions that you're raising.  I believe that we can work them out.  But those are specific questions as opposed to broad, philosophical questions about whether government ever has a role to play or not. Keep in mind, finally -- and this is the last point that I'll make -- that you have a bunch of countries that have systems in which government is involved but you still have a thriving private insurance market -- The Netherlands being a good example.  Everybody is covered.  Everybody has care.  The government has regulations in there.  But it does not somehow take over the entire private insurance market.  So I just want people to understand nobody is talking about a government takeover of health care.  I want to repeat that one last time. All right.  I've got -- I've got one last -- I've got time for one last question.  I'm going to call on this young lady right here.  Oops, she just lost her question.  Go ahead.  Who's got a microphone?  Right here, right here. Q    I cannot believe that we have the President of the United States of America in Grand Junction, Colorado!  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Good to be here. Q    We are so proud of you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.) Q    My name is Marie Elena, and I live in the Western Slope in Montrose, Colorado.  And I am a naturalized citizen, and I am proud to be an American in this beautiful land.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Q    As a child I had polio, and I had a series of surgeries, 52 of them, to correct my poor structure of bones -- between here, Denver, Montrose, and the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona.  I have been blessed with a good insurance, generally excellent doctors and care.  However, my major concern in cost, even with good -- even with a good insurance, the cost has been high, practically when I have been gone out of the network.  Why should our doctor treatment choice be limited by a geographic area or the state?  What kind of competition is this, Mr. President?  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, all right. Q    Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  This raises an important question, because it goes to the overall debate that's taking place out there right now.  When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it.  Well, that's what's going on right now.  It's just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies. Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world anytime, regardless of expense.  That would be a hard system to set up.  So if you live in Maine, you know, we're going to fly you into California, put you up.  I mean, you can see -- and I'm not trying to make light of it -- you can just see the difficulty. So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what's going on, et cetera.  That's being done currently in the private marketplace. All we're trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren't discriminating against people because they're already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending. So let's make sure, for example, that if you go to a hospital, you get one of those operations that you discussed, and it turns out that two weeks later you've got to be readmitted because they didn't do it right the first time, that the hospital has to pay some penalty for that, or at least they're not being reimbursed as much as a hospital who gets it right the first time.  That's an example of changing incentives that can save us money. The more that we make those kinds of changes that improve quality, reduce cost, the more likely it is that more Americans have more options and that they are not being jerked around.  It doesn't mean that everything is going to be perfect, but it does mean that consumers will have more choices, better options, more security, more protection. That's all we're trying to accomplish here and we're trying to do it in a way that over time reduces costs overall for families, whether you're getting Medicare or you're getting Medicaid or you've got private insurance through your employer or you're a small business owner.  That's what we're trying to accomplish. And I am confident that we can accomplish it -- but we're going to have to work hard to do it, and we're going to have to overcome some of the wrong information, and we're going to have to have an honest debate.  Nothing is going to be perfect.  We're going to have to make sure -- this is something, by the way, that people need to understand:  Even if everything goes perfectly and we pass legislation, let's say, in October, we're still going to have another three months of debate about this, then we're still going to have several years of implementation.  It's not going to happen overnight.  We're going to have to set up these reforms and these processes, and we're going to have to give insurance companies the chance to adjust, because, for example, if we don't have everybody covered, we can't construct a system that prevents insurance companies from discriminating against preexisting conditions.  I hope everybody understands that. We can't tell insurance to take everybody if, on the other hand, you've got a whole bunch of people who are healthy and young who choose not to get insurance at all, because what ends up happening is then insurance companies are just going to take the people when they get sick.  Somebody won't buy insurance until they find out that they're sick.  Then they go into the insurance office and they say, give me insurance so I can go pay my bill.  Insurance companies would lose money pretty quick that way. So if we're going to eliminate the preexisting conditions problem, we've got to also -- have the coverage problem, and that's why this is going to have to be phased in over a number of years. Last point I want to make, and this has to do with the budget issues, because we've got a huge deficit right now and a huge debt, and I think that that's coloring how people view the debate.  I hear a lot of people say, how can we afford this right now?  We've got to reduce our deficit. First, I want everybody to understand the source of our deficit, because if you don't understand that, then my argument won't make sense.  When I walked into the White House, I had gift-wrapped, waiting for me at the door a $1.3 trillion deficit -- $1.3 trillion.  Now, I say that -- (applause) -- I just want to -- I just want to -- I just want to -- I say that -- this was not -- and this is not, by the way, entirely the previous administration's fault.  The financial crisis was so bad that revenues plummeted and all this money was spent in making sure that the banking system did not completely collapse.  So all the actions that have been taken -- the bank bailout, the auto bailout, all that stuff -- that did spike the deficit. But the problem actually is not that -- you know, the extraordinary steps that we've taken over these last one or two years.  The real problem is much longer.  Even if we had had no fiscal crisis whatsoever, we have a structural deficit.  We're spending more money than we are taking in.  We've been doing it for the last eight years.  When we passed the prescription drug benefit for Medicare, by a Republican Congress, they didn't pay for it.  They didn't want to raise taxes, but they wanted to get the benefit.  That just was red ink.  That just went into our structural deficit. When we fought the Iraq war, we made that decision.  We didn't pay for it.  When we cut taxes on some of the wealthiest Americans, we did not compensate by making cuts in programs that were comparable.  So what that has all added up to is, we've got a structural deficit that over the course of the next 10 years is about $9 trillion. Now, I say that because I just want everybody to understand, if we're going to tackle that problem, the only way we can do it in an intelligent way is if we get control of Medicare and Medicaid spending in some realistic way.  If we don't do that -- if we don't do that, we can't simply cut our way out of the problem or tax our way out of the problem. I ask sometimes, when I'm in audiences, what people think the amount of federal budget is devoted to foreign aid.  And people will say, 25 percent; if we could just cut that out, we could eliminate the deficit.  Foreign aid is 1 percent of our budget -- 1 percent.  People think, well, it's all these pork projects and earmarks that everybody is getting.  One percent.  Almost all of our spending is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the national debt, defense spending -- things that are very hard to cut. Only about -- only about 30 percent of the overall budget, somewhere between 25 and 30 percent is non-defense discretionary spending.  That's everything for national parks, for education, you name it.  Every single program that you think of that you think of as a government program, that is only about 25 percent of the budget.  The rest of it is all Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  And what's really going up fastest is Medicare and Medicaid. So I just want everybody to understand, if you are a fiscal hawk, if you are -- if you are a deficit hawk and you are tired of this crazy spending in Washington and you want to finally make sure that we are looking out for the next generation, then you, more than anybody, should want to reform the health care system -- because if we don't do it, we can't solve that problem.  (Applause.) Thank you, Grand Junction.  Love you.  (Applause.)                                                              END    5:10 P.M. MDT

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
AT KEEP INDIANA BLUE FUNDRAISER
The Westin
Indianapolis, Indiana
6:36 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Indiana!  (Applause.)  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to see you.  Hello, hello, hello!  (Applause.)  It is good to be here.  (Applause.)  And it's a pleasure to be with your outstanding representatives in Congress -- Andre Carson, Joe Donnelly, Brad Ellsworth, Baron Hill -- give it up for these outstanding members of Congress.  (Applause.)  We're here to make sure they can stay right where they belong:  in the United States Congress, representing your hopes, representing your dreams, carrying your voices to Washington, DC. (Applause.)   
It's good to be back in Indiana.  (Applause.)  We spent a little time in Indiana.  It reminds me of why I like getting out of Washington so much.  People are friendly.  (Laughter.)  It brings back a lot of memories from all those days out here on the campaign trail.  So I want to start out tonight by saying thank you -- thank you to all of you here in Indiana.  (Applause.)  I know that I'm here tonight because of you, and folks like you across this country who made the phone calls, and knocked on the doors, and registered voters, and dug deep and gave whatever you could, because you were hungry for new ideas and new leadership and a new kind of politics.  And that's what we are trying to deliver right now in Washington.  (Applause.)   
You believed that after an era of selfishness and greed, we could reclaim a sense of responsibility from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington.  You believed that instead of huge inequalities and bubbles that bust, we could restore a sense of fairness and stability to our economy, and build a new foundation for lasting growth and prosperity.  You believed that at a time of war and turmoil, we could stand strong against our enemies, stand strong for our ideals, and show a new face of American leadership around the world.  (Applause.)  That's the change you believed in; that's the trust you placed in me; that's something that I will never forget.
But we know that winning that election was just the beginning of our work.  It wasn’t the end, it was just the start -- it was the end of the beginning.  That victory alone was not the change that we sought -- it was just the opportunity to make the change.  And I don't know about you, but I think it's fair to say that over these past four months, we have seized this opportunity.
To jumpstart job creation and get our economy moving again, we passed the most ambitious economic recovery package in our nation's history.  We gave tax cuts to 95 percent of working Americans and put back people to work modernizing our health care system; and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and transit systems; and investing in renewable energy that could help boost our economy and preserve our planet. 
We launched plans to stabilize our housing market and unfreeze our credit markets, and to ensure the survival of our auto industry in this new century.  We passed a budget that will cut our deficit in half while making investments to spur long-term growth.  (Applause.)  
We lifted the ban on federal funding for stem cell research. We expanded the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 11 million children in need.  (Applause.)  We passed a national service bill to create hundreds of thousands of opportunities to serve.  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- the first bill I signed into law, because we believe in equal pay for equal work.  (Applause.)  
So we're making progress.  And I'm pleased with how far we've come -- but I'm not satisfied.  I'm confident in the future, but I am not content.  Not when there's still workers who are out of a job, and families who can't pay the bills.  Not when too many Americans can't afford health care, and so many of our kids are being left behind.  Not when our nation has failed to lead the world in developing 21st century energy.  We've come a long way, we can see some light on the horizon, but we've got a much longer journey ahead.
That's why all of you are here tonight.  That's why you're digging deep again, even when times are a little tight -- why I know you're going to make those calls and knock on those doors and get to the polls again next November -- (applause) -- because we've got to make sure these four leaders continue their devoted service to Indiana and to America.  (Applause.)  
And that's why I'm here tonight.  That's why I'm here, because I can't bring the change I promised all by myself.  I can't rebuild our economy, and reform our health care system and our education system, and preserve our environment, and keep our nation safe if I'm all alone in the Oval Office.  That's not how our democracy works. 
I need partners in Congress -- people who are going to work hard every day to move this country forward.  That's why I'm supporting these gentlemen.  That's why I believe in Andre Carson and Joe Donnelly and Brad Ellsworth and Baron Hill.  (Applause.) They serve their constituents and this nation with dedication and intelligence and compassion and pride.  They're determined to make a difference for the people they represent. 
More than ever before, we need their help -- America needs their help.  We need their help to build schools that meet high standards, and close achievement gaps, and prepare our children for the 21st century challenges that they'll confront; where we reward teachers for performance and give them new pathways for advancement.  And we need their help to reach the goal that I've set for higher education in this country:  that by the year 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  We used to have that distinction; we don't anymore.  We are going to get it back with the help of these four gentlemen right here.  (Applause.)  
We need their help to pass a comprehensive energy plan and climate bill that will finally reduce our dependence on foreign oil, cap carbon pollution that threatens our health and our climate -- (applause) -- a plan that will create millions of new jobs producing wind turbines and solar panels and the alternative fuels that will power the future.  Because we know that the nation that leads on energy, on clean energy in the 21st century, that's the nation that will lead economically -- and America can and must be that nation. 
I need these gentlemen's help to create a 21st century health care system that's cutting costs for families and businesses.  (Applause.)  I've already met with representatives from the insurance and drug companies, from doctors and hospitals and labor unions.  These groups, some of them used to be fierce critics of health care reform back in 1993.  But today, they've pledged to do their part to reduce the annual health care spending growth rate by 1.5 percent.  And coupled with comprehensive reform, that could save us up to $2 trillion -- $2,500 per family every year.  And working with these congressmen, we're going to do everything we can to achieve comprehensive health care reform by the end of this year.  (Applause.)
Are we going to get it done, gentlemen?  (Applause.)  This is the year to get it done. 
And we need these gentlemen to help give working people in this country a fair shake again.  (Applause.)  To make sure our workers can be paid fairly and treated fairly for the work that they do.  I've got to say a few words about where we're gathered tonight.  It's a fine establishment.  But there are workers here from Indianapolis hotels who are seeking to unionize -- (applause) -- including some right here at the Westin.  And I want to recognize these workers and offer my support for their efforts.  Where are they?  Raise your hands, guys.  Right here.  (Applause.)  We appreciate you. 
In these difficult times, our country will be stronger if management and workers come together to resolve disputes and work together to provide quality service.  And workers should never be punished for demanding the right to collectively bargain -- (applause).  That's not right; we won't stand for it.  (Applause.)
And finally, we need these four leaders to help us restore fiscal discipline in Washington so we don't leave our children and grandchildren with a mountain of debt.  These are some of the leaders in trying to get Washington to take those responsibilities seriously.  Already, my administration has identified more than 100 government programs that we can reduce or eliminate, save $17 billion next year alone.  We're going line by line through the budget, page by page, looking for even more cuts. 
I've personally asked the leadership in Congress to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule that we followed during the 1990s, a rule that will help start -- (applause) -- a rule that helped us start this new century with a $236 billion surplus.  You remember that?  The idea is very simple:  You don't spend what you don't have.  If you want to spend, you need to find someplace else to cut.  That's the rule that families across this country follow every single day -- and there's no reason why their government shouldn't do the same.
So, look, Indiana, we're living through some extraordinary times.  We didn't ask for the challenges we face, but we're determined to answer the call to meet them; to cast aside the old arguments, overcome the stubborn divisions, to move forward as one people.
It won't be easy and there's going to be setbacks.  It's going to take time.  This is going to be a hard year -- and next year is not going to be so easy either.  But I promise you that we will get through this.  I'll always tell you the truth about the challenges we face and the steps that we're taking, and I'll continue to measure my progress by the progress the American people are seeing in their own everyday lives.  (Applause.)  
And if you stand with me, if you stand with Andre Carson and Joe Donnelly and Brad Ellsworth and Baron Hill -- (applause) -- then I know we will look back on this moment, at the time that we came together to reclaim America's future, to write the next great chapter in the American story.  (Applause.) 
Thank you, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless America.  (Applause.)

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
AT DNC FUNDRAISING RECEPTION


 
October 15, 2009
Westin St. Francis Hotel
San Francisco, California 


8:00 P.M. PDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Nancy Pelosi!  Hello, San Francisco!  (Applause.)  Hey!  How are you?  Hello.  It’s good to see all of you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a couple of quick special thank yous.  I love all of you.  (Applause.)  But there are a couple people I want to make sure to acknowledge.
First of all, thank you Tracy Chapman for performing tonight.  (Applause.)   Love Tracy Chapman.  Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi, who is running for the California 10 upcoming election –- everybody has got to go out there and work for John.  (Applause.)  There he is right –- stand up, John, so everybody can see you.  (Applause.)   Fantastic.
Let me tell you about Nancy Pelosi.  Somebody in an introduction was saying everybody has a kind word to say about Nancy Pelosi, her generosity, her intelligence.  All that's true.  Let me talk to you –- Nancy Pelosi is tough.  (Laughter.)  I want everybody to know that.  I mean, every day –- every day –- she is subjected to constant criticism and griping.  And then there’s the other party.  (Laughter.)
But with style and grace, but most importantly, with steely determination, she does not back down, she is there doing battle each and every day on behalf of not only her constituency here in California, but people all across America who are looking for a fair shake, who are looking for a decent job, who are looking for quality health care, who want a good education for their kids, who want a planet that they can pass on to their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.  That's what Nancy Pelosi is all about.  We could not have done any of the stuff that we’ve done this year without one of the best Speakers imaginable.  So, please, everybody, I know sometimes you're not a prophet in your own land but I want everybody to understand how special Nancy Pelosi is and give her a big round of applause.  (Applause.)
It’s good to be back in California.  (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!
THE PRESIDENT:  I love you, too.  (Applause.)  I appreciate the warm welcome –- especially the weather.  (Laughter.)  It just got cold in D.C., so I was happy flying in over the Bay and it’s sunny; it’s nice.  (Laughter.)  This is a pretty place you guys live.  (Applause.)  But obviously what I appreciate even more is the opportunity that you’ve given me and my administration to serve on your behalf.  And I’m here to tell you that we are keeping faith with your support.  We are working every single day to fulfill your hopes.  Every day we’re asking ourselves how can we realize the dreams that led so many people to join our cause when it seemed so improbable.
 
But I’ve got to say, looking out at a room full of so many supporters, I am reminded of what President Lincoln once said to one of his own supporters who claimed that it was his efforts that made the difference in the election. The guy had come in, he met Lincoln, he said, it’s because of you –- “It’s because of me that you’re sitting here.”  “So you think you made me President?” Lincoln said.  “Yes,” the man replied, “under Providence, I think I did.”  “Well,” said Lincoln, “it’s a pretty mess you’ve got me into.  But I forgive you.”  (Laughter and applause.)  That's how I feel about you.  (Laughter.)  You're all forgiven.  (Applause.)
 
It’s been about 10 months since the Obama family packed up and moved to Washington.  And I want to report to you that Malia and Sasha are doing great.  (Applause.)  Michelle has been extraordinary as First Lady.  (Applause.)  We have Bo, which has lowered my seniority to fifth at the dinner table.  (Laughter.)
But I do think it’s important for all of us to remember, even though it’s been almost a year, what was happening in this country when we walked through that front door –- because, you know, people seem to have a sort of selective memory.  (Laughter.)  People seem to forget, they seem to think that suddenly I was sworn in and there was this big financial crisis.  (Laughter.)  So let’s just do a little walk down memory lane.  (Laughter.)
We were facing an economic crisis unlike any that we’ve seen in our times.  We were losing 700,000 jobs a month.  Our financial system was on the brink of collapse.  Economists of every political stripe we’re saying we might be slipping into the next Great Depression.
 
And that’s why working with Nancy Pelosi and working with Harry Reid we passed boldly and swiftly a Recovery Act that’s made a difference in the lives of families and communities in every corner of the country.  And California has been particularly hard hit.  And I know families here are struggling more than folks in a lot of other parts of the country.  And leaders are having to make tough choices about how to navigate through this economic storm.  But I also know that if it hadn’t been for that Recovery Act here in California and all across America, if it weren’t for the Recovery Act we’d be in a much deeper hole.  And that is a fact.  (Applause.)
 
We put a tax cut in the pockets of small business owners and 95 percent of working Americans -– just as I promised on the campaign trail.  That tax cut has benefited more than 12 million families here in California at a time when they were losing income, and in some cases losing jobs.  Increased unemployment insurance for 12 million Americans to help them get through tough times.  (Applause.)  That's helped nearly 2 million Californians.  We made COBRA 65 percent cheaper –- (applause) -- to make sure that when you are out there looking for a job you could still have your health insurance.  We provided relief to states like California so they wouldn’t have to lay off teachers and firefighters and police officers.  (Applause.)  Gave 30,000 loans to small businesses all across America -– including nearly 4,000 right here in California -– that have helped to create and save tens of thousands of private sector jobs.
 
But the Recovery Act wasn’t just about tax cuts -– the most progressive, by the way, tax cuts in American history.  It wasn’t emergency relief for middle class families and working families who’ve borne the brunt of the recession.  It also was the largest investment in education in American history.  (Applause.)  It was also the largest investment in clean energy in American history.  (Applause.)  It was also the largest investment in the nation’s infrastructure since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System back in the 1950s –- (applause) –- putting people back to work all across the country, rebuilding roads and bridges and waterways.
 
That’s not all we did in those first few months.  Nancy –- Nancy mentioned a few other things.  We decided maybe it makes sense to pay women the same as men for the same work.  (Applause.)   And that's why we signed the Lilly Ledbetter –- the first bill I had the honor to sign into law.  Lifted the ban on stem cell research –- (applause) -- began to restore science to its rightful place here in America.  Extended health insurance to 11 million children across the country who had been left out, under the Children’s Health Insurance bill.  (Applause.)  Passed legislation to protect consumers from unfair rate hikes and abusive fees charged by credit card companies.  (Applause.)  Passed laws to protect our children from being targeted by big tobacco companies.  (Applause.)  Made sure that housing fraud was prevented.  (Applause.)  Placed a new national policy for the first time in our history aimed at both increasing fuel economy and reducing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States.  (Applause.)
 
That’s what we did here at home.  Abroad, we began a new era of engagement.  (Applause.)  Working with partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons –- (applause) -- and seek the long-term goal of a safer, more secure world free of nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)  Working in concert with other nations on just about every continent to stem the global economic downturn and to confront climate change.  We banned torture.  (Applause.)  We’re closing Guantanamo.  (Applause.)  We’re rebuilding our military.  We’re reaffirming our alliances.  We are drawing down responsibly and ending the war in Iraq.  (Applause.)  We made good progress in taking the fight to al Qaeda –- from Pakistan to Somalia to Indonesia.  I went to Cairo on behalf of America to start a new dialogue with the Muslim world.  (Applause.)
 
So just in case you're wondering what we’ve been doing over the last nine months –- (laughter) –- thought it might be useful to check in with you.  (Laughter.)  You wouldn’t always know it watching cable.  (Laughter.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Don’t watch it!

THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary  _____________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                      September 29, 2009  REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND NATO SECRETARY GENERAL ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN  AFTER MEETING  Oval Office 12:09 P.M. EDT   PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Hello, everybody.  I just want to welcome Secretary General Rasmussen to the Oval Office.  He and I had the opportunity to get to know each other at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, at which he was nominated and then selected as the new Secretary General of NATO.  I can say that, given his experience as a head of state, that everybody had confidence in his decisive and effective leadership abilities.  That confidence has proven justified.  In the brief time that he has been in NATO, I think he's already shown himself to be an active and effective Secretary General, interested in reforming and renewing the NATO Alliance, and always rooted in the understanding that this is the most successful military alliance in history and the cornerstone of transatlantic relationships. We had a very fruitful discussion while he was here.  We talked about, obviously, the most important NATO mission right now, and that is Afghanistan.  And we both agree that it is absolutely critical that we are successful in dismantling, disrupting, destroying the al Qaeda network, and that we are effectively working with the Afghan government to provide the security necessary for that country.  This is not a American battle; this is a NATO mission, as well.  And we are working actively and diligently to consult with NATO at every step of the way.  And I'm very grateful for the leadership that Secretary General Rasmussen has shown in committing NATO to a full partnership in this process. We also discussed missile defense, and we both agreed that the configuration that we have proposed is one that ultimately will serve the interests of not only the United States, but also NATO Alliance members most effectively.  It allows for a full collaboration with NATO members, and we are very optimistic that it will achieve our aims and deal with the very real threat of ballistic missiles. We also agree that it is important for us to reach out to Russia and explore ways in which the missile defense configurations that we envision could potentially lead to further collaboration with Russia on this front; and that we want to improve generally not only U.S.-Russian relations, but also NATO-Russian relations, while making absolutely clear that our commitments to all of our allies in NATO is sacrosanct and that our commitment to Article 5 continues. Finally, we discussed the process that we're putting forward for a strategic concept review.  NATO has been so successful that sometimes I think that we forget this was shaped and crafted for a 20th century landscape.  We're now well into the 21st century, and that means that we are going to have to constantly renew and revitalize NATO to meet current threats and not just past threats.  There has been a process that has been put forward; we are fully supportive of it.  I am confident that under Secretary General Rasmussen's leadership that it will ultimately be successful, and that we will continue to see NATO operate in a way that is good for U.S. national security interests, good for our allies, and good for the world. So, Mr. Secretary General, thank you for the excellent work that you're doing and we appreciate it very much.  And please feel free to share a few words. SECRETARY GENERAL RASMUSSEN:  Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your kind words.  The President and I have had a very constructive meeting.  I have thanked the President for his strong support.  I look very much forward to cooperating with the President and his administration on reforming, transforming, and modernizing NATO.  We are going to elaborate a new strategic concept, which I hope can serve as leverage for renewal of NATO. Of course, our main focus today has been our cooperation in Afghanistan.  I say ""our"" focus deliberately because our operation in Afghanistan is not America's responsibility or burden alone.  It is and it will remain a team effort.  I agree with President Obama in his approach:  strategy first, then resources.  The first thing is not numbers.  It is to find and fine-tune the right approach to implement the strategy already laid down, and all NATO allies are right now looking at McChrystal's review. I'm convinced that success in Afghanistan is achievable and will be achieved.  And don't make any mistake -- the normal discussion on the right approach should not be misinterpreted as lack of resolve.  This Alliance will stand united and we will stay in Afghanistan as long as it takes to finish our job. As the President mentioned, we have also discussed missile defense.  I welcome the new U.S. approach, which will allow all allies to participate, which will protect all allies.  And in fact, I think the proposed new system can serve as an instrument to bind all allies -- new and old -- even stronger together. Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Thank you so much.  All right, thank you, everybody.                 END    12:17 P.M. EDT

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
		REGARDING JOHN ROOS, AMBASSADOR-DESIGNATE TO JAPAN

		Oval Office

		2:55 P.M. EDT

		THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  I think many of you are aware that a partnership between the United States and Japan is one of tremendous interest.  It's one of the cornerstones of our both security and economic well being.  We have an extraordinarily close relationship based on shared values and shared interests.  There is enormous respect between the people of Japan and the people of the United States.

		And it's for that reason that my administration wants to get off on a strong footing diplomatically through our relationship.  And I placed great importance in the selection of who would represent the United States as Ambassador to Japan.  And after careful consideration I made the determination that the person who I thought could best do this is somebody with superb judgment, somebody with an outstanding intellect, somebody who is a very close friend of mine and a close advisor, somebody who has worked both in the private sector with cutting-edge technologies, but also is somebody who has a deep interest in public service.  And that's my friend, John Roos.

		He is somebody who I'm confident is going to be able to help to strengthen both the regional and the global relationship between the United States and Japan.  He's somebody who will be able to advise me directly on issues that may arise and opportunities that may arise in the U.S.-Japanese relationship.  He is somebody who is I know going to be working incredibly hard to make sure that he is listening to and understanding the full scope of Japanese concerns.  And so I very much appreciate his willingness to take on those tasks.

		He and his wife, Susie, and his family are prepared to -- and eager -- to travel to Japan.  It's a sacrifice to, obviously, uproot yourself, but John has shown nothing but great enthusiasm for what is one of the most important diplomatic tasks that we have in the country.  And I'm grateful for his service and confident that he is going to represent not only my administration, but the United States of America with extraordinary ability.

		So thank you so much, John.

		 REMARKS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT
		TO THE GEORGIAN PARLIAMENT
		 
		Parliament Hall
		Tbilisi, Georgia

		 
		VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the Parliament, distinguished leaders, friends all, I thank you for this great honor.  I do consider it an honor to be given the floor in your Parliament.
		 
		I speak not only on behalf of myself as Vice President, but I speak for my President, President Obama, as well as my country.  I come here on behalf of the United States with a simple, straightforward message:  We, the United States, stand by you on your journey to a secure, free and democratic, and once again united, Georgia.  (Applause.)
		 
		It’s a journey nearly a century in the making.  In May of 1918, the National Council of Georgia -- this very body, under a different name -- declared independence, much as my own nation did 150 years before that.  Three years later, you adopted a constitution, a brave declaration of your freedom and independence, even under the imminent threat of an attack.
		 
		One month later, the Bolshevik occupation was complete, and this parliament met for the last time until the end of the century.  It was a journey halted before it began.  But the journey renewed in 1989, as the cries for freedom rang throughout Georgia once again, only to be stopped one more time by the last grasp of a dying empire.  Two years later, you declared your independence again, and a seed planted generations before became a rose about to bloom. 
		 
		Georgia’s first post-Soviet experiment with democracy was tainted with civil strife, economic hardship, growing corruption, and a backward drift toward undemocratic rule.  Then, just six years ago, the Rose Revolution sounded a clarion call for freedom and democracy that was literally heard around the world.
		 
		I still draw inspiration from that moment and the journey you have taken.  I remember watching in awe as you stood straight and tall.  So did millions of people around the world whose quest for freedom is not yet complete.
		 
		One year ago, as the Speaker referenced, I came to Georgia under very different circumstances.  I was advised by many not to come.  I was told that it wasn't a particularly opportune moment.  But I wanted to make clear why your independence was so important to my country and the world.  Instead of standing in your parliament, I sat on the rooftop of a restaurant with President Saakashvili, as the sound of artillery fire and fighter aircraft punctuated the night. 
		 
		On that rooftop, I pledged America's support to Georgia in my status as the United States Senate.  And I here today pledge it again, as Vice President of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  I pledge it not only on my behalf, but on behalf of President Barack Obama.  
		 
		This visit, Tbilisi -- to Tbilisi, comes deliberately right after President Obama’s trip to Moscow, for as he was planning his trip -- (applause) -- as he was planning his trip, he instructed me to plan my trip to Tbilisi.
		 
		Ladies and gentlemen -- and I know that some are concerned, and I understand it, that our efforts to reset relations with Russia will come at the expense of Georgia.  Let me be clear:  They have not, they will not, and they cannot.  (Applause.)   
		 
		As I said in Munich in the first days after our administration was sworn in, and as President Obama, I might add, reasserted two weeks ago in Moscow, we stand by the principle that sovereign democracies have the right to make their own decisions, and choose their own partnerships and their own alliances.  We stand against the 19th century notion of spheres of influence.  It has no place in the 21st century.  (Applause.)
		 
		We will not -- we will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.  (Applause.)  And we urge -- we urge the world not to recognize them as independent states.  And we call upon Russia to honor its international commitments clearly specified in the [ *sic] 12 ceasefire agreement, including withdrawal of all forces to their pre-conflict positions, and ultimately out of Georgia.  (Applause.)
		 
		And we support the expansion of international monitors throughout Georgia to promote peace and stability.  During my visit last year, I was moved by the plight of families displaced from their homes in South Ossetia.  And I was struck by the effort to undermine your economy by targeting critical infrastructure deep within Georgia. 
		 
		I promised that my country would provide meaningful assistance to Georgia to help you recover.  And today, I am pleased to say that the United States has delivered on that commitment I made of $1 billion.
		 
		Ladies and gentlemen, since August, we have provided supplies and shelter to those displaced, budgetary support to help your government meet its fiscal responsibilities, reconstruction aid to help those who were able to return home, and funding for roads and energy security; and new resources to strengthen Georgia’s civil society, legal system and independent media.
		 
		All in all, Georgia today is one of the highest per-capita recipients of U.S. aid in the entire world.  Even where I come from, a billion dollars for 5 million people is a lot of money.  We are also working closely with Georgia to modernize your military, with a focus on training, planning and organization.
		 
		We understand that Georgia aspires to join NATO.  We fully support that aspiration.  (Applause.)  And, members of Parliament, we will work to help you meet the standards of NATO membership.
		 
		I am pleased that just last month, the U.S. and Georgia launched a Charter on Strategic Partnership.  We set an ambitious agenda across four key areas:  defense and security; economic trade, and energy cooperation; advancing democracy and the rule of law; and strengthening cultural ties between our countries.
		 
		Let me be clear about what our strategic partnership with Georgia is, and what it is not.  The United States has no desire to create our own sphere of influence in this region or anywhere else in the world.  Our goal is to help build a multi-partner world in which nations make common cause of common concerns.
		 
		These partnerships are not being built against anyone.  They are being built to the benefit of everyone who seeks a more democratic, prosperous and secure world.  (Applause.)
		 
		With Georgia, our partnership involves meeting security challenges -- we are grateful, truly grateful that Georgian soldiers will stand next to our brave Marines in Afghanistan.  It includes a commitment to energy security, and we welcome Georgia’s role as a bridge for natural resources flowing from east to west, as it did a thousand years ago.  (Applause.)
		 
		It carries with it -- this cooperation agreement -- a determination to build stronger bonds not only between our governments, but among our people through cultural exchanges, entrepreneurial collaboration, and civil society cooperation.
		 
		Our partnership rests on a foundation of shared democratic ideals.  That's what you are about.  And we will continue to support your work to fulfill the democratic promise of six years ago. 
		 
		As President Saakashvili told Parliament earlier this week -- and we expect that he will keep that commitment -- that there is much more to be done.  Your Rose Revolution will only be complete when government is transparent, accountable, and fully participatory; when issues are debated inside this chamber, not only out on the streets; when you fully address key constitutional issues regarding the balance of power between the parliament and the executive branch, and leveling your electoral playing field; when the media is totally independent and professional, providing people the information to make informed decisions, and to hold their government accountable for the decisions it makes; when the courts are free from outside influence and the rule of law is firmly established, and when the transfer of power occurs through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic processes, not on the street.
		 
		Ladies and gentlemen -- I don't mean to sound instructive -- never tell another person what their political interest is.  But I can tell you from experience there is no specific checklist for democracy.  But there are significant, concrete steps that need to be taken to deepen any democracy.
		 
		Success requires the involvement of everyone in this room, of those who were elected outside this room.  It requires every Georgian citizen, regardless of their political affiliation or their ethnicity, to take part in their government. 
		 
		And I especially today call upon the young people of Georgia, the next generation of Georgian leaders, to continue to contribute their ideas, their voices, and their energy to help create a peaceful, stable, democratic and economically prosperous Georgia.  Only then -- only then will we see a Georgia that is the home to all its rightful citizens. 
		 
		As difficult as this may be, I encourage you to keep the doors open to the Abkhaz and South Ossetians, so that they know they have other options besides the status quo.  Instability or renewed conflict guarantees, in our view, a continuation of the unacceptable status quo, and it would discourage the foreign investment that is so essential to the economic growth and the economic progress you so badly need. 
		 
		It is a sad certainty, but it is true there is no military option to reintegration, only peaceful and prosperous Georgia -- a peaceful and prosperous Georgia that has the prospect of restoring your territorial integrity by showing those in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a Georgia where they can be free and their communities can flourish; where they can enjoy autonomy within a federal system of government, where life can be so much better for them than it is now.  Show them the real benefits of your nation’s motto: Strength is in unity.
		 
		Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen of the Parliament -- divided, Georgia will not complete its journey.  United, Georgia can achieve the dreams of your forebears and, maybe more importantly, the hopes of your children.
		 
		I’ll end with a phrase -- a verse from maybe Georgia's most famous poet.  When I was in the president's office I asked, ""Who is that portrait of?""  And he then gave me the history lesson on, again, maybe your most famous poet, a poet who inspired the journey of freedom in 1921 -- and continues to provide his voice today.  And I want to make sure I get this right.  He wrote:  ""My heart burns with a holy flame that all my strength I may employ, to serve my people faithfully in sorrow and in joy.  O let my people's suffering be branded on my soul I ask, and let my heart, through good and ill, be equal to its task.""  (Applause.)
		 
		Ladies and gentlemen, my President and I, my country, we pray that your hearts are equal to the task.  I know they are, and so do you.  And thank you so very much for not only inspiring your own people in completing this journey, but for the inspiration you've provided for tens of millions of people seeking what you now have within your grasp.  And it is yours to guarantee.

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
			ON THE RECENT ELECTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

			South Lawn


		1:39 P.M. EDT

		THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to say a few words about this week's election in Afghanistan. This was an important step forward in the Afghan people's effort to take control of their future, even as violent extremists are trying to stand in their way.

		This election was run by the Afghan people. In fact, it was the first democratic election run by Afghans in over three decades. More than 30 presidential candidates and more than 3,000 provincial council candidates ran for office, including a record number of women. Some 6,000 polling stations were open around the country, and Afghan National Security Forces took the lead in providing security.

		Over the last few days -- and particularly yesterday -- we've seen acts of violence and intimidation by the Taliban, and there may be more in the days to come. We knew that the Taliban would try to derail this election. Yet even in the face of this brutality, millions of Afghans exercised the right to choose their leaders and determine their own destiny. And as I watched the election, I was struck by their courage in the face of intimidation, and their dignity in the face of disorder.

		There is a clear contrast between those who seek to control their future at the ballot box, and those who kill to prevent that from happening. Once again, extremists in Afghanistan have shown themselves willing to murder innocent Muslims -- men, women and children -- to advance their aims. But I believe that the future belongs to those who want to build -- not those who want to destroy. And that is the future that was sought by the Afghans who went to the polls, and the Afghan National Security Forces who protected them.

		The United States did not support any candidate in this election. Our only interest was the result fairly, accurately reflecting the will of the Afghan people, and that is what we will continue to support as the votes are counted, and we wait for the official results from the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission and the Electoral Complaints Commission.

		Meanwhile, we will continue to work with our Afghan partners to strengthen Afghan security, governance, and opportunity. Our goal is clear: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and their extremist allies. That goal will be achieved -- and our troops will be able to come home -- as Afghans continue to strengthen their own capacity, and take responsibility for their own future.

		Our men and women in uniform are doing an extraordinary job in Afghanistan. So are the civilians who serve by their side. All of them are in our thoughts and prayers, as are their families back home. This is not a challenge that we asked for -- it came to our shores when al Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan. But America, our allies and partners, and above all the Afghan people share a common interest in pursuing security, opportunity, and justice.

		We look forward to renewing our partnership with the Afghan people as they move ahead under a new government. I want to again congratulate the Afghanistan people on carrying out this historic election, and wish them a blessed month as they come together to welcome the beginning of Ramadan.

		Thanks very much, everybody.

		Q What about the hero's welcome in Libya, sir?

		Q Do you consider Libya a terrorist state, sir?

		THE PRESIDENT: I think it was highly objectionable.

REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA
AND PRESIDENT ABBAS OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
IN PRESS AVAILABILITY

Oval Office

5:15 P.M. EDT

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Hello, everybody.  Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome President Abbas to the Oval Office.  We had -- we just completed an extensive conversation, both privately as well as with our delegations, about how we can advance peace in the Middle East and how we can reaffirm some core principles that I think can result in Palestinians and Israelis living side by side in peace and security.

As I've said before, I've been a strong believer in a two-state solution that would provide the Israelis and Palestinians the peace and security that they need.  I am very appreciative that President Abbas shares that view.  And when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here last week I reiterated to him that the framework that's been provided by the road map is one that can advance the interests of Israel, can advance the interests of the Palestinian people, and can also advance the interests of the United States.

We are a stalwart ally of Israel and it is in our interests to assure that Israel is safe and secure.  It is our belief that the best way to achieve that is to create the conditions on the ground and set the stage for a Palestinian state as well.  And so what I told Prime Minister Netanyahu was is that each party has obligations under the road map.  On the Israeli side those obligations include stopping settlements.  They include making sure that there is a viable potential Palestinian state.  On the Palestinian side it's going to be important and necessary to continue to take the security steps on the West Bank that President Abbas has already begun to take, working with General Dayton.  We've seen great progress in terms of security in the West Bank.  Those security steps need to continue because Israel has to have some confidence that security in the West Bank is in place in order for us to advance this process.

And I also mentioned to President Abbas in a frank exchange that it was very important to continue to make progress in reducing the incitement and anti-Israel sentiments that are sometimes expressed in schools and mosques and in the public square, because all those things are impediments to peace.

The final point that I made was the importance of all countries internationally, but particularly the Arab states, to be supportive of a two-state solution.  And we discussed how important it is that the Arab states, building off of some of the recognition of the possibilities of the two-state solution that are contained in the Arab Peace Initiative continue to provide economic support, as well as political support, to President Abbas's efforts as he moves the Palestinian Authority forward, as he continues to initiate the reforms that have taken place, and as he hopefully is going to be able to enter into constructive talks with the Israelis.

So, again, I want to thank President Abbas for his visit and a very constructive conversation.  I am confident that we can move this process forward if all the parties are willing to take on the responsibilities and meet the obligations that they've already committed to, and if they keep in mind not just the short-term tactical issues that are involved, but the long-term strategic interests of both the Israelis and the Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security.

So, thank you again, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT ABBAS:  (As translated)  Thank you very much, Mr. President, for receiving us here at the White House.  We came here to tell you first of all that we congratulate you for the confidence that was expressed by the American people in electing you President of the United States.  And we wish you all success in your mission.

Mr. President, you referred to the international commitment as we stipulated in the road map.  I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm to you that we are fully committed to all of our obligations under the road map, from A to Z.  And we believe, like you, Mr. President, that carrying out the obligations of all parties under the road map will be the only way to achieve the durable, comprehensive, and just peace that we need and desire in the Middle East.

Mr. President, I believe that the entire Arab world and the Islamic world, they are all committed to peace.  We've seen that through the Arab League Peace Initiative that simply talks about land for peace as a principle.  I believe that if the Israelis would withdraw from all occupied Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese land, the Arab world will be ready to have normal relationships with the state of Israel.

On our part, we are carrying our security and responsibility in the West Bank, and have law and order in that areas under our control because we believe that it is in our interest to have security.  It's in the interest of stability in the region.  And here I would like to pay tribute and thank you to General Dayton and all those who work with him in helping and supporting and training our security organizations to carry out their duties and responsibilities.

Mr. President, I believe that time is of the essence.  We should capitalize on every minute and every hour in order to move the peace process forward, in order to cement this process, in order to achieve the agreement that would lead to peace.

Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Thank you.  We got time for a couple of questions.  Julianna.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm going to ask you a question about your trip next week to Riyadh.  Reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil is a cornerstone of your energy policy.  And when you meet with Riyadh's King Abdullah next week, what message will you take to him about U.S. energy policy, oil prices, output quotes, and the like?

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, you know, Saudi Arabia has been an important strategic partner in providing us with our critical energy needs.  We appreciate that.  It's a commercial relationship as well as a strategic relationship.

And I don't think that it's in Saudi Arabia's interests or our interests to have a situation in which our economy is dependent, or better yet, is disrupted constantly by huge spikes in energy prices.  And it's in nobody's interest, internationally, for us to continue to be so heavily dependent on fossil fuels that we continue to create the greenhouse gases that threaten the planet.

So in those discussions I'll be very honest with King Abdullah, with whom I've developed a good relationship, indicating to him that we're not going to be eliminating our need for oil imports in the immediate future; that's not our goal.  What our goal has to be is to advance the clean energy solutions in this country that can strengthen our economy, put people back to work, diversify our energy sources.

And, you know, interestingly enough, you're seeing the Saudis make significant investments both in their own country and outside of their country in clean energy, as well, because I think they recognize that we've got finite -- we have a finite supply of oil.  There are going to be a whole host of countries like China and India that have huge populations, need to develop rapidly.

If everybody is dependent solely on oil as opposed to energy sources like wind and solar, if we are not able to figure out ways to sequester carbon and that would allow us to use coal in a non-polluting way, if we don't diversify our energy sources, then all of us are going to be in trouble.  And so I don't think that will be a difficult conversation to have.

Q    (Question asked in Arabic.)  Mr. President, if Israel keeps declining to accept the two-state solution and to freeze the settlement activities, how the U.S. would intervene in the peace process?

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  We'll, I think it's important not to assume the worst, but to assume the best.  And in my conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu I was very clear about the need to stop the settlements; to make sure that we are stopping the building of outposts; to work with the Palestinian Authority in order to alleviate some of the pressures that the Palestinian people are under in terms of travel and commerce, so that we can initiate some of the economic development plans that Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has said are so important on the ground.

And that conversation only took place last week.  I think that we don't have a moment to lose, but I also don't make decisions based on just the conversation that we had last week because obviously Prime Minister Netanyahu has to work through these issues in his own government, in his own coalition, just as President Abbas has a whole host of issues that he has to deal with.

But I'm confident that if Israel looks long term -- looks at its long-term strategic interests, that it will recognize that a two-state solution is in the interests of the Israeli people as well as the Palestinians.  And certainly that's how the United States views our long-term strategic interests -- a situation in which the Palestinians can prosper, they can start businesses, they can educate their children, they can send them to college, they can prosper economically.  That kind of situation is good for Israel's security.  And I am confident that the majority of the Israeli people would see that as well.

Now, obviously the Israelis have good reason to be concerned about security, and that's why it's important that we continue to make progress on the security issues that so often end up disrupting peace talks between the two parties.

Q    (Previous question translated.)  President Abbas, you've met with President Obama, and perhaps you shared some of your ideas about permanent status resolution.  What was in these ideas, and what kind of appropriate mechanism that you have discussed to realize them and carry them out?

PRESIDENT ABBAS:  We have shared some ideas with the President, but all of them basically are embodied in the road map and the Arab League Initiative, without any change, without any modification.

Regarding the mechanism to carry it out, of course, there is a mechanism through the Quartet as well as the follow-up committee from the Arab nations.  Such a proposal will need to be looked at, studied; then we'll see where to go from here.

Q    Mr. President, do you plan to unveil any part or all of your proposal for Mideast peace when you're speaking in Cairo next week, or is it some other message you intend to deliver?

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I want to use the occasion to deliver a broader message about how the United States can change for the better its relationship with the Muslim world.  That will require, I think, a recognition on both the part of the United States as well as many majority Muslim countries about each other, a better sense of understanding, and I think possibilities to achieve common ground. 

I want to emphasize the importance of Muslim Americans in the United States and the tremendous contributions they make, something that I think oftentimes is missed in some of these discussions.  But certainly the issue of Middle East peace is something that is going to need to be addressed.  It is a critical factor in the minds of many Arabs in countries throughout the region and beyond the region.  And I think that it would be inappropriate for me not to discuss those.

I'm not going to give you a preview right now, but it's something that we'll certainly discuss.

One thing that I didn’t mention earlier that I want to say I very much appreciate is that President Abbas I think has been under enormous pressure to bring about some sort of unity government and to negotiate with Hamas.  And I am very impressed and appreciative of President Abbas's willingness to steadfastly insist that any unity government would have to recognize the principles that have been laid by the Quartet.

In the absence of a recognition of Israel and a commitment to peace, and a commitment to previous agreements that have already been made, it would be very hard to see any possibility of peace over the long term.  And so I want to publicly commend President Abbas for taking that position because I think it's a position that's in the interest of the Palestinian people, in the interests of peace in the region, and it's something that the United States very much agrees with.

Q    (Asked in Arabic.)  Mr. President, if I may, President Bush hoped that you would have a Palestinian state by the time he leaves office.  It didn't happen.  Do you have a time frame when this Palestinian state is going to happen?  Are you talking about a timetable for negotiation?

(Previous question translated.)  The first question to President Abbas:  Mr. President, did you receive any kind of clear-cut commitments from President Obama, or any pledges that would help you to strengthen your hands when you are dealing with the Palestinian public and opposition among Palestinians that this peace process activities could be viable and could be actually productive?

And the second question was, did President Obama ask you to have a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu?

PRESIDENT ABBAS:  President Obama basically talked and reaffirmed the international commitments that we all agreed to, and they are all embodied in the road map.  He talked about the necessity to have two states, he talked about the importance of stopping settlement activities, and he also talked about the importance of achieving peace through negotiating all permanent status issues.

Obviously without discussing and negotiating permanent status issues there will be no progress.  We know that all the six issues of permanent status were discussed with the previous Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, and what is needed right now is to resume the discussions with the current Israeli government.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  And in terms of a timetable, I have not put forward a specific timetable.  But let me just point out, when I was campaigning for this office I said that one of the mistakes I would not make is to wait until the end of my first term, or the end of my second term, before we moved on this issue aggressively.  And we've been true to that commitment. 

From the first week that I arrived in this office, I insisted that this is a critical issue to deal with, in part because it is in the United States' interest to achieve peace; that the absence of peace between Palestinians and Israelis is a impediment to a whole host of other areas of increased cooperation and more stable security for people in the region, as well as the United States.  And so I want to see progress made, and we will work very aggressively to achieve that.

I don't want to put an artificial timetable, but I do share President Abbas's feelings and I believe that many Israelis share the same view that time is of the essence, that we can't continue with a drift**, with the increased fear and resentments on both sides, the sense of hopelessness around the situation that we've seen for many years now -- we need to get this thing back on track.  And I will do everything I can, and my administration will do everything I can -- my special envoy, George Mitchell, is working as diligently as he can, as is my entire national security team, to make sure that we jumpstart this process and get it moving again.

All right.

 THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary  __________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                                                        October 9, 2009 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT  ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION East Room  2:37 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Patricia, thank you so much for sharing your story, and doing such a wonderful job. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I start with my remarks I want to acknowledge some people who've been working diligently on this issue, in some cases for years. First of all, our Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner is here. Christina Romer, the Chair of -- there she is -- of my Council of Economic Advisers, is here. Senator Danny Akaka from Hawaii; Representative Steve Driehaus of Ohio; Representative Walt Minnick of Idaho; Representative Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania; Representative Al Green of Texas. Karen Mills, our outstanding Administrator of the Small Business Administration; Sheila Bair, who's been doing a heroic job trying to deal with the banking situation as Chairman of the FDIC; Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia; and my National Economic Advisor, Larry Summers. And finally, we've got some special guests, some of the finest attorney generals who are fighting against consumer fraud and have been dealing with some of the consequences of the issues that we're discussing here today -- I'm proud to have them here: My former seatmate in the Illinois State Senate, Attorney General Lisa Madigan; Andrew Cuomo of New York; Martha Coakley of Massachusetts; and Roy Cooper of North Carolina. Please give them all a big round of applause. (Applause.) Now, for the last several months, this administration has been working with Congress to reform an outdated system of financial regulations and lax oversight that helped lead to last year's crisis. And I want to thank some people here who are working tirelessly on this issue -- first of all, Chairman Chris Dodd of the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Barney Frank of the House Financial Services Committee, Richard Shelby, also of the Senate Banking Committee -- for the leadership and enthusiasm that they have shown throughout this process. Part of our reform effort involves putting in place new safeguards that would help prevent the irresponsibility and recklessness of a few from wreaking havoc on our entire financial system. We want to close gaps in regulation; we want to eliminate overlap; and we want to set rules of the road for Wall Street that make fair dealing and honest competition the only way for financial firms to win and prosper. But a central part of our reform effort is also aimed at protecting Americans who buy financial products and services every day -- from mortgages to credit cards. It's true that the crisis we faced was caused in part by people who took on too much debt and took out loans they couldn't afford. But my concern are the millions of Americans who behaved responsibly and yet still found themselves in jeopardy because of the predatory practices of some in the financial industry. These are folks who signed contracts they didn't always understand offered by lenders who didn't always tell the truth. They were lured in by promises of low payments, and never made aware of the fine print and hidden fees. Secretary Geithner and I just finished meeting with some of these Americans who've joined us here today. And you've already heard from Patricia, who was forced to pay thousands of dollars in interest on a $550 payday loan. And we also had a chance to hear from Susan Chapman, who had excellent payment history until she was contacted by a broker who told her that she could lower the monthly payments on her mortgage. Instead, the loan they sold her ended up increasing her debt, and her principal has now gone up $20,000. We talked to Karen Cappuccio, who is still fending off foreclosure because her mortgage company duped her into taking out two expensive loans when they had originally promised her one low, fixed-rate mortgage. We talked to Maxine Given, whose bank hit her with four separate overdraft charges because of one mortgage check that they ended up rejecting the very next day. And I should add, by the way, that this is a CPA that we're talking to here. So if it's happening to her, if it's happening to Maxine, then imagine what the rest of us who can barely add are dealing with here. We talked to Andrew Giordano, whose bank made a mistake that cost him $800 in overdraft fees. And when he caught their mistake, the bank only refunded part of the fees. As we've seen over the last year, abuses like these don't just jeopardize the financial well-being of individual Americans -- they can threaten the stability of the entire economy. And yet, the patchwork system of regulations we have now has failed to prevent these abuses. With seven different federal agencies each having a role, there's too little accountability, there are too many loopholes, and no single agency whose sole job it is to stand up for people like Patricia, Susan, Maxine, Andrew and Karen -- no one whose chief responsibility it is to stand up for the American consumer, and for responsible banks and financial institutions who are having to compete against folks who are not responsible. So under the reforms we've proposed, that will change. The new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that I've asked Congress to create will have just one mission: to look out for the financial interests of ordinary Americans. It will be charged with setting clear rules of the road for consumers and banks, and it will be able to enforce those rules across the board. This agency will have the power to make certain that consumers get information that is clear and concise -- in plain language -- so they can compare products and know exactly what they're getting themselves into. It will ensure that banks and other firms can't hide behind these ridiculously confusing contracts -- pages and pages of fine print that nobody can figure out. It will have the ability to enforce and build on the credit card reforms we passed earlier this year, so that consumers aren't hit with unfair rate hikes and penalties, or hidden charges. It will require brokers to look out for the interests of families if they give advice about mortgages. And it will ensure transparency and fair dealing for other financial products, like bank overdraft services and payday loans. In a financial system that's never been more complicated, it has never been more important to have a watchdog function like the one we've proposed. And yet, predictably, a lot of the banks and big financial firms don't like the idea of a consumer agency very much. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions on an ad campaign to kill it. You might have seen some of these ads -- the ones that claim that local butchers and other small businesses somehow will be harmed by this agency. This is, of course, completely false -- and we've made clear that only businesses that offer financial services would be affected by this agency. I don't know how many of your butchers are offering financial services. (Laughter.) Contrary to what some have argued, this agency would not restrict consumer choice and innovation. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the past, a lack of clear rules led to innovation of the wrong kind: The firms that did best were the ones who did the best job of hiding the real cost to consumers. We don't want them competing by figuring out how much they can fool ordinary Americans. By contrast, the consumer agency we're proposing would set ground rules so that firms don't have to compete to confuse families, but they have to compete to give them better choices. This will also help small business entrepreneurs who often rely on credit cards and home equity loans to finance their start-up businesses. All this hasn't stopped the big financial firms and their lobbyists from mobilizing against change. They're doing what they always do -- descending on Congress, using every bit of influence they have to maintain the status quo that has maximized their profits at the expense of American consumers, despite the fact that recently a whole bunch of those same American consumers bailed them out as a consequence of the bad decisions that they made. And since they're worried they may not be able to kill this agency, they're trying their hardest to weaken it -- by asking for exemptions from this agency's rules and enforcement; by fighting to keep every gap and loophole they can find. They're very good at this, because that's how business has been done in Washington for a very long time. In fact, over the last 10 years, the Chamber alone spent nearly half a billion dollars on lobbying -- half a billion dollars. The stories we heard today, they remind us that the American people can't afford business as usual any longer. These Americans can't afford high-priced lobbyists to argue their case. They're counting on us to be their advocates, to be their voice, to restore a sense of responsibility from Wall Street to Washington. That's why we need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will stand up not for big banks, not for financial firms, but for hardworking Americans. (Applause.) That's why we need regulatory reform that will reward innovation and competition instead of short-cuts and abuses. That's why we can't let special interests win this fight. We've already seen and lived the consequences of what happens when there's too little accountability on Wall Street and too little protection for Main Street, and I will not allow this country to go back there. It is time for us to move forward. It is time for real change. And I'm confident that we're going to get it done, with the help of all the people who are here today, and, most importantly, with the help of the American people, who are going to demand a better deal from their financial services. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END   2:49 P.M. EDT

REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY 
TO THE EGLIN AND HURLBURT COMMUNITY
 

Hanger 103
Eglin Air Force Base, Florida
 

4:01 P.M. CST
MRS. OBAMA: Goodness. Wow. (Applause.) Well, this is -- I'm thrilled. You know, you all have been standing in the heat. (Applause.) Now, that's love. (Applause.) But I am just thrilled to be here.
First, let me begin by thanking a few people -- your general, General Davis, for his kind introduction but also for his leadership. I want to thank not just the general but his wife, Susan, because we always have to remember the women behind the men, or the spouses behind the leaders. (Applause.)
In addition to the general and Susan, I want to thank Colonel McClintock and his wife, Tammy. I want to thank Chief Master Sergeant Thomas Westermeyer and the Commander Chief of the Air Armament Center, and his wife Diane. I want to thank Colonel Bill* McMullen, Vice-commander of the First Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field for their outstanding leadership. (Applause.)
The President and I are grateful for your service. We are grateful. And I know that folks at Eglin and Hurlburt are grateful for your dedication and your commitment and your leadership. I have had a wonderful opportunity to sit down with the commanders and with folks leading the Family Readiness Unit, and working in child care. And I've learned such a great deal about the community that you all are building here. It is a model for the nation, and it was an honor for me to be here and to talk with all of you.
I also want to acknowledge Vicki Miller, the wife of Congressman Jeff Miller, who's taken the time to be here to greet me. Although her husband is voting back in Washington, she has been a dear friend and supporter. Vicki, where are you? Give a wave. (Applause.) Thanks for being here, Vicki. (Applause.)
And thanks also to the many elected and community leaders who are here. I met many of them earlier today. And I want to thank all of them for the support of our men and women in uniform. You can do a lot in a base community, but the community that a base is in extends far and wide, and it takes the mayors, the non-elected officials, the community service leaders, the folks embracing you all. And the folks here are blessed to have a very strong community, and I want to give them a round of applause as well. (Applause.)
I also want to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Rob Lyman, who isn't here because he's currently at work in the U.S. Department of Transportation. He is one of 15 people chosen out of 1,000 applicants to be a White House Fellow. You should be very proud. That's a tough program to get into, and he is there representing you well -- (applause) -- and I want to thank you all for loaning him to us for this short period of time.
I know firsthand just how extraordinary the people are that come from Eglin. And I know firsthand because we have somebody who works very closely with our family, Major Jeff Keuter, who would be very embarrassed that I'm even mentioning his name. He was here at Eglin for three years, and he is now our family's physician. So Major Keuter takes excellent care of me and the President and the girls. They even chip in when Bo needs a hand. (Laughter.) And I would like to ask him to stand up so he can -- there he is over there, very embarrassed. (Applause.) We are very proud of him. He keeps us healthy.
I'd also like to say a personal word of thanks to the 728th Air Control Squadron –- the Demons –- (applause) -- who just returned home last month from Iraq and Qatar -– the unit's sixth deployment since 2003. Welcome home. We're proud of you. (Applause.)
Look, I know so many of you -- these folks, the Demons and so many people protect my husband and Vice President Biden when they travel, so they have a special place in my heart for sure, and I want to give them a thanks on behalf of the Obamas and the Bidens. You guys are terrific, and we are grateful to you.
Now, as somebody, as you know, who cares very much about military families, I was very pleased to hear that the Air Force leaders designated this year the ""Year of the Air Force Family."" And that's very -- a very -- (applause) -- important statement to make. And I was even more pleased when General Schwartz said the year would be devoted both to highlighting what's working for families, and also figuring out what isn't working for families, so that we can take the steps to fix it.
Because that's actually a pretty good description of what I've been trying to do for the past few years as I visit our troops and their families all across the country. My dear friend, Dr. Jill Biden, the Vice President's wife, and I have been asking questions, we've been listening –- trying to get feedback on what's going on, what models work, what models don't -- and we're working to make sure that your voices are heard in Washington and that we can figure out how to raise up best practices and make sure that our efforts in Washington are trickling down to the folks who matter most -- and that's our servicemen and women and their families.
And visiting with servicemembers and their families is truly one of the greatest things that I do as First Lady. It's one of my greatest privileges because I always come away from these visits with a renewed sense of pride, and gratitude, and a sense of awe -- truly a sense of awe.
I stood in a line and heard story after story of your colleagues that's been deployed for most of their time as servicemembers; their stories of bravery, how they left their families, how they dealt with fire, how they continued to recover -- and each and every one of them are ready to do more. So I'm in awe of the courage, the patriotism and the commitment to excellence that our men and women in uniform display every single day.
It's a commitment I see every time that my family steps aboard Air Force One or on Marine One, or interacts with any of the members of our military that oversee operations at the White House. My husband and I say this all the time: The training that you receive is the best. And you come out so whole and ready for so much that you don't even know -- and it makes us proud of the military.
I'm in awe of the sacrifices that you make -– a small fraction of our population bearing such a huge burden for eight years of war -- I'm in awe -- serving tour after tour of duty, missing out on birthdays, and anniversaries, and soccer games, moments with people that you love the most. I'm in awe. I'm in awe of every single one of you.
But I'm also in awe of the loved ones here, the people who have your back. I know that service doesn't end with the person wearing the uniform -- and you all know that -- and war doesn't end when servicemen and women come home. I know that our troops' sacrifices are their families' sacrifices too.
I have met spouses who play the roles of both parents, trying to keep the household together, making their children feel like everything is okay, juggling play dates and lessons and soccer games, trying to hide fears and worries, trying to calm nerves, and doing their best to answer all those questions that both the mother and father should answer -- but they're handling it alone, and they're doing it with grace.
I have met grandparents, and aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, who step in to care for children when there's a single mom or dad that's in uniform and they're deployed.
And I have met families who are caring for wounded warriors, those whose brave loved ones have given the ultimate sacrifice. I've met all those people.
And the thing that always strikes me isn't just that there are hardly ever complainers in these groups –- even when that would be understandable. And it isn't just that they're not asking for any kind of special treatment ever -- even when the most -- most of them would certainly deserve some special treatment.
But I'm struck by how, at a time when they're making the greatest sacrifice of all, when they're already stretched so thin in their own lives, they somehow find time to reach out a hand and help somebody else. That is always the story. I am struck by how even with all they've got going on, they somehow find a way to do even more and to give back to the communities that they're in. This is the constant message that I get from these visits.
And that is certainly the case here at Eglin and at Hurlburt. I've heard those stories. You all are involved in everything from Relay to Life, to the Boy Scouts, to Toys-for-Tots. You're volunteering in your local churches and your schools, and even more.
In fact, I'm told that one of the youth programs in this community gets about half of its volunteer coaches from troops staffed here at Eglin. Half of their volunteers come from you all. And I hear that you've taken on the challenge -- the Combined Federal Campaign -- with a vengeance, donating whatever you can to help others.
So I think it's pretty clear that our men and women in uniform and their families have more than done their duty to this nation.
So I think it now falls upon us, as a grateful nation, to do ours in return. It's our turn to look out for you. So that's why my husband's budget includes a few things -- like pay raises for men and women in uniform -- (applause); additional permanent forces to reduce the stress of long deployments; support for military spouse career development -- (applause) -- that's something that we hear; improved military housing, yay -- (applause); and financial assistance to military families who've had to sell their homes during the housing crisis and are facing losses. (Applause.)
And we've heard from military families that there were some additional steps that could be taken so that military families can more fully benefit from the Family and Medical Leave Act.
So Congress has been working to extend federal family leave protection to the family members of our regular active duty personnel so that they can take time off from work to be with their servicemember for deployment-related activities or to attend important family responsibilities.
And I am so pleased that Senator Chris Dodd is working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to extend federal family leave protection to the family members of injured veterans. If enacted, this legislation will help more military families address the unique issues they face in balancing work and family.
But providing our military and their families with the support they've earned requires more than just good government; it requires an active citizen as well. Let's never forget that when our troops go off to war, they're protecting every single one of us. And the freedoms that they fight for are ones that every single one of us as Americans enjoy. And that's why I've made it a personal priority to ask all Americans to do their part to show our appreciation. (Applause.)
And the community that you're in right now, as I said earlier, is a shining example of how that can be done -- from throwing barbecues and the shrimp boil -- that I didn't get invited to, but that's okay -- (laughter); to donating facilities for community events; to showing appreciation with gifts at the holidays; from a 13-year-old girl who started Hero Hugs to send cards and care packages to servicemembers abroad; to an 84-year-old woman who's spent 43 years volunteering at Eglin hospital. You all know how important it is to support our men and women in uniform, and we thank you for that.
But the thing is, not every community has a military base, as you know. Not every community is as blessed as Eglin is. We've got National Guard and Reserve families in cities and towns all across the country. We've got wounded warriors working hard to recover, and families struggling to cope with the loss of the person that they loved most in the world.
So I encourage everyone in this country to reach out through your schools, to reach out through your churches and your workplaces to find out if there are servicemembers or military families nearby who can use a hand. Just look around in your own community. And it can be something as simple -- you know what your Family Readiness support groups do -- it's something simple as offering babysitting, or handling carpool duty, or giving a stressed mom a break; bringing over a meal. It doesn't really take that much.
If you own a business, think about making an effort to hire a military spouse or a veteran with that open position when you get one. If you have a professional skill, whether you're a lawyer, or an accountant, or a mental health professional, you can offer services to our military families pro bono.
At the very least, each of us can do one simple thing -- and that is to take the time to say thank you. Just take the time to say thank you. Thank you for the sacrifices that you are all making on behalf of this nation. And we can thank you all for all that you do to serve our communities, every last one of you.
And today, I'm thinking of one particular example that I heard about here at Eglin –- the clothing drive a group of Airmen started to help children they'd met in an orphanage in Grenada while they were supporting my husband's trip to the Summit of the Americas. Before they knew it, so many donations had poured in that they had to end the drive. That's because everybody here stepped up. It took two entire days just to sort out what they had received.
It's a perfect illustration of the spirit of our military and our military families. It's what makes our armed forces the best in the world -- (applause) -- and not just because of your courage in the face of adversity, or your heroism on the battlefield, but your compassion, and your decency, and your generosity.
See, that is the face of America that the world gets to see. They see this country through your eyes as well -- through your good deeds. And in doing so, you make us so proud, so very proud.
So I know times get hard. I know that. There is no way that I can know intimately how hard it can be, but I am committed as First Lady to spend every ounce of my platform trying to make sure that the country never forgets; that they don't forget our servicemembers and they certainly don't forget those that are left here to keep it together. (Applause.)
So know that you're not alone. Know that there are so many people who are sending their prayers and their appreciation and their gratitude. When I travel around the world, people talk about our military. They talk about how you represent the world, and they talk about how it is a duty of all of us to make sure that we honor the work that you do. So thank you.
And now let's get out of this heat. (Laughter and applause.)

PRINCIPAL DEVAN:  Viers Mill, what's our goal?
STUDENTS:  Read!  Read!  Read!
PRINCIPAL DEVAN:  Because great readers have?
STUDENTS:  Great choices!
THE PRESIDENT:  So you guys are readers.  And so, being a reader myself, I wanted to come meet all these outstanding readers.  Because you guys are reading so much and you're working so hard, you guys are doing great in terms of your test scores and how this school is doing.  And so this was just a great example of how much improvement a school can make just in a really short time when you've got motivated kids.
So I wanted to come by and introduce myself, to say I'm very proud of you.  I am hoping that you guys will continue to read, read, read, and that all of you are going to be really working hard not just this year but all the way through high school and then all the way through college, because how many people here plan to go to college?  Everybody, right?  I just wanted to make sure everybody's going to college.  But that means everybody's going to have to work hard.
So here's what I'm going to do.  I didn't want to give a long speech.  What I'm going to do is I'm just going to come around, I'm going to shake people's hands, I'm going to say hi to folks, and I'm sure that somebody out there is going to be taking a bunch of pictures.  (Laughter.)  And you guys can tell me what you've been reading.  All right?  So get ready to tell me what you've been reading lately and what's going on.  All right?  Okay, guys.

THE WHITE HOUSE   Office of the Vice President  ___________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                      April 16, 2009  REMARKS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT  ON HOW THE RECOVERY ACT  IS BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY IN MISSOURI  AND ACROSS THE NATION   ABB Transformer Factory  Jefferson City, Missouri   4:08 P.M. CDT   THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Folks, before I begin my formal remarks, since I have that bad reputation of telling it straight, I want to tell you something.  I always feel good when I got the UAW behind me, in front of me, to my right and to my left.  I wouldn't be in office without you all.  (Applause.)   And now, thank you so much, Charlie.  Look, the truth is I come from a state that was a UAW state.  We're in tough shape, my UAW, my Chrysler local, my GM local.  We're in deep trouble.  We may not -- many of my guys and women may not survive this transitional automobile industry.  But you know the standard that the President and I have used in terms of what constitutes recovery in this economy is not merely whether or not the economy grows again.  It will grow again.  We will lead again.  But what we will not consider a success is if we grow and we lead again, but the middle class does not grow with that growth.  (Applause.)   Ladies and gentlemen, the UAW and the union movement have built the middle class of America.  But from 19 -- from 2001 to 2008, productivity in America grew by 20 percent, but the old bargain had been broken:  Middle-class households actually lost several thousand dollars over that -- that 10 -- that eight years.   So, folks, the measure for us is, for those aspiring to and those in the middle class, when we grow out of this economic doldrum we're in, if we don't raise the standard of living for you all, then we haven't succeeded.    And ladies and gentlemen, you can still lead a decent life.  You can still live in a good neighborhood.  You can still have dreams for your kids.  You can still be able to afford all the basic necessities if you have a decent wage and a decent job.  And that's what we're about -- trying to preserve those.   I want to thank you all.  I want to thank the management here who has been steadfast, innovative and, quite frankly, is part of the future; understands what kind of platform we have to build for a new economy in the 21st century.   I also want to thank former governor -- you can tell he was a former governor, he's so sure -- Secretary of Commerce Locke, for helping lead our country in a new era of innovation and progress.    Folks, it's not that this can't be done.  This can be done.  The first thing I started this morning was with President Obama.  We started in what they call the Executive Office Building, making an announcement for what will amount to more than a $15 billion investment in -- what, $13 billion investment in high-speed rail -- good jobs, an economic future that understands our energy needs and how to save it and how to connect this country in a way.   And some people say it can't be done.  The Gov knows it could be done.  My friend from over 30 years, Ike, knows.  All you got to do is go to France or China and get on a train and you'll go up to 300 miles an hour.  And they say it can't be done in America?   Well, ladies and gentlemen, the President says there's nothing in the world we cannot do.  We have the best workforce, we have the best people, we have the greatest ingenuity of any nation on Earth.    And ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Locke -- and he referred to the Secretary of Energy, the new guy -- not a whole lot of Nobel Laureates in physics who are Secretaries of anything -- this guy is the real deal, the Secretary of Energy; he's a Nobel Laureate.  Science is back, folks, in the White House.  And we're going to do -- is we're going to help, with your help, transform this country.   You know, as I walked around the plant and got a cook's tour of what you're doing and how you're doing it, it's clear you're going to help grow our economy.  But I know as I walked around the plant today that what I saw was the future -- was the future.  You guys are just right here at the beginning, you're in the ground floor -- the ground floor of what could be the economic engine that not only gets us out of this doldrum we're in, but literally, literally propels this nation to be able to lead the world in the 21st century the same way we did in the 20th century.    I'll tell you what I saw.  I saw what I'm used to seeing at every UAW factory I go into.  I saw hard-working people who are smart as heck, knew what they were doing, and took pride -- took pride in what they do.  I saw you filling good jobs, creating not just transformers, but building a sturdy platform for the new economy of the 21st century, a new economy that's going to be built by the 643 of you here at ABB -- not just making transformers, but the many thousands more like you all around the country that will make, for example, 8,000 different parts that it takes to create a single wind turbine -- and by the millions around the country, assembling a better economic future for everybody.   As you heard, because of the investments from the Recovery Act -- and you all, we use these terms like the Recovery Act.  That's where Barack Obama went to the Congress and did something no one has ever done before.  He said, I need another $787 billion now -- now -- to go out now and invest in this economy, save jobs, to create jobs.  We're not going to wait.  We're not going to wait.  Too many of your brothers and sisters are really in hard times.    And so we did something amidst -- in the midst of an economic downturn that had never been done before.  And then he made a big mistake.  He said, Biden, you're in charge.  (Laughter.)  And I'm proud to be in charge of how this money is going to be spent, and whether or not we spend it in an unusual way -- completely transparent for all the world to see; completely accountable so we answer for what we've done, and efficiently.    And ladies and gentlemen, you heard about this act, but let me tell how it works.   You have maintained jobs here because an outfit called Lost Creek Ridge Wind Farm, which was ready to put on hold its projects, was able, through this Recovery Act, to get the money to make its project happen.   We tried to do our part.  One of the things they have been able to do is complicated stuff you all understand.  It's almost boring, but it's important to understand, as they say, connect the dots, like the Secretary of Commerce connected the dots about why a Smart Grid is so consequential for people.   Ladies and gentlemen, we put in a tax system of financial incentive.  It's called a production tax credit.  It sounds awful fancy, which may not sound particularly helpful or innovative, but don't let that fool you.  It invests about $14 billion -- $14 billion -- in precisely the kinds of projects that you're undertaking here -- exactly the same spirit, the same spirit we know that venture capitalists, those private investors, who put their weight behind projects and hoped to get a big return in. Those folks now are awful hesitant to invest their money, because they don't think much is happening in the economy right now.  So we stepped in.  We came up with an innovative way to say, okay, we're going to get companies like this windmill company to be able to move forward.   So our Recovery Plan not only provides direct money, but also provides key incentives, too.  The Department of Energy has allocated $6 billion to underwrite, to guarantee, in effect, the ability to get investments up to $60 billion, it will generate, in loans for renewable energy projects, just like the one you're going to be a part of making sure gets built here.  These guarantees give folks the confidence that they need to make a safer bet on a greener future.   So now with those efforts we've spurred the state's largest wind energy development, generating roughly -- electricity just in this one project.  This is just one example around the nation to generate enough electricity to power at least 50,000 homes.  Clean energy, clean energy.  Renewable energy -- not needed to be imported.  No one has to do anything except the wind blow.   Because the Lost Creek project is a go, there are around 100 wind turbines supplied by GE, and so are the transformers for ABB needed to bring that all to life.  So the dots get connected, folks.  It matters.  It matters for your job.  It matters for our future.  It matters for my kids and my grandkids.    This, in a nutshell, is a story of the Recovery Act.  Every way we can use the money to leverage other money being invested in good projects, to directly spur on the kind of investment every one of you know we need.  Talk to your brothers and sisters in the automobile industry.  I'm going to say something that maybe I shouldn't say.  You guys made the product, but the design you were given wasn't the one you came up with.   So ladies and gentlemen, we got to get smarter, and that's exactly what we're doing.  And this is a story of ABB Incorporated and Lost Creek Wind Ridge Farm.  This is a story of how the new economy that's predicated on innovation and efficiency is going to inspire the kind of growth we need.  This is a story that we're going to write together, you and me.  We're going to write this story together.   On the signs around this plant you say you're making transformers.  But ladies and gentlemen, there's so much more here than meets the eye.  We've heard for years that a greener economy will benefit and prevent the gridlock that existed; that it will put our grandkids in a position that they will inherit a better planet.  True, but that's not the whole story.    Barack and I are not waiting for our grandkids.  We've got real live people like you sitting in front of us and standing in front of us, who right now -- right now -- need to be able to use your innovation, energy and skill to be able to make a decent living and to help build this country like every generation of workers has done.  That's the reason this country is strong.  We spend this great economic power we have.   So we're building a green economy for us, as well.  It will increase the bottom lines of businesses and individuals through greater efficiency; lower gas prices by reducing our dependence on foreign oil; return America to our rightful place as the leading edge of progress in the world.    Think about it.  When you were growing up, did a single one of you think America wasn't the leading nation in the world?  I mean, did it even cross your mind that that would be in question?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's not going to be if we and you have anything to do with it.   So that's what we're doing here.  And this is what Secretary Locke and I are doing here.  We're seeing first-hand the people whose sweat and fingerprints will be all over this new economy.  This new economy is not going to be built by Wall Street and investors; it's going to be built by you, like every single solitary era in our history has been built by the workers who create the productivity and give us the muscle and strength to be the nation we've always been.    And our commitment to you doesn't end with making sure wind farms can continue to go into production.  I'm happy to announce today the Department of Energy plans to distribute nearly $3.4 billion -- $3.4 billion -- in Smart Grid technology development grants.  Your management here, and all of you, you are in the business of being able to compete for those.  This is jobs -- jobs.    In addition, there's $615 million for Smart Grid storage, monitoring and technology viability.  Talking with your management and talking with you guys; that's all within your wheelhouse.  My brother has an expression.  He said, ""That's in your wheelhouse, Joe.""  It's all in your wheelhouse.  You all have the capacity to do the things we're dreaming about you being able to do.    Just as Secretary Locke was discussing earlier, a true, smart and resilient electrical grid is necessary to ending America's reliance on foreign oil.  How many think we'd have so many troops stationed in that area of the world if we didn't need the oil?  You know, if you add the actual price of oil, it's probably $10 more a barrel just by the military we have to provide to be able to ensure those oil lanes stay open among other things.   Ladies and gentlemen, it's also -- it's also necessary -- it's necessary to ensuring the delivery of renewable sources of energy to consumers across this country.  And it's necessary to be creating the jobs that are not going to be able to be exportable, that will pay a living wage, a decent wage, and allow people in the middle class to sustain their standard of living and see it grow, and have a promise for their kids.   You know, when I was growing up in Scranton, even though my dad lost his job and told us we had to move -- like a lot of you probably experienced -- my dad never doubted for a second that things would come back.  I was raised in a neighborhood like some of you closer to my age who said -- when your parents said, look, you can do anything you want to do as long as you work hard, as long as you are honest, as long as you do the right thing, as long as you support your country -- and we believed it.  And we did it.  But how many parents feel the certainty of being able to say that to their kids right now, because they see things blow up in their face through no fault of their own.   Well, ladies and gentlemen, one of the ways to ensure that future again is to get in front of the technical -- technological revolution that is necessary to sustain and make this world survive; and that's a new green economy, particularly as it relates to energy.   These necessary upgrades are going to allow us to modernize our electrical grid, improve its efficiency and reliability while stimulating local economies while saving consumers' money.  And right here in Missouri, the Lost Creek Wind Project will be designed with Smart Grid components in mind.  That's what the next piece of this puzzle is.   All components will be connected through a high-speed communications, and monitored through a system that provides real-time production data from that wind farm.  This is what allows renewable energy sources like wind to be effectively and efficiently integrated into the electrical grid, and allows us to take wind from the Midwest and power urban areas all across the country.  We have vast renewable resources in this country that are untapped; wind is only one example.  But to take advantage of it, you've got to bring the power to where the people are, and that depends on a bigger, smarter grid and that's what we're starting -- this is the base of what we're developing here.   In the end you ask for bringing much more efficiency into our energy production.  But as we do it, we'll also be creating jobs, non-exportable jobs, good-paying jobs, not just any jobs.  We'll be leaving men and women like you with the ability to have jobs that can't be exported which are going to be the foundation for a new economy -- jobs you can keep forever.   It was a President from Missouri named Harry Truman who faced a similar uncertainty at the end of World War II.  When he became President he said, and I quote, ""May we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage.  In that way, America may lead the world to peace and prosperity.""  We are the world's hope to lead it to peace and prosperity as Truman's generation did.  His words are as true today and the optimism should be as real today as it was after 12 million men and women came home after having been in arms.   Hard workers like you are the core -- the core -- literally the core of that glorious heritage.  And together we're going to once again lead the world in peace and prosperity.  And it starts by building a foundation, a foundation for a new economy.  And it's going to be built on your shoulders, on your ingenuity, and your hard work.  I promise you that.  I promise you that.   So, folks, next time I come back I hope I see 1,244, and then 2,050.  I hope I see all over America -- all over America, by the time our term ends, real live good-paying jobs with companies making real profits, once again leading the world.   We're counting on you.  And I hope you know you can count on us.  Thanks for what you do.  May God bless you.  May God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)   END  4:29 P.M. CDT

THE WHITE HOUSE   Office of the First Lady  _____________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                                      May 29, 2009  REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY  DURING BANCROFT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL VISIT   Bancroft Elementary School  Washington, D.C.   2:14 P.M. EDT        MRS. OBAMA:  Well, that's hard to follow.  (Laughter.)  I mean, those were just some amazing presentations.  Carlos, Cierra, Tammy, David, I am so proud of you all -- I mean, because it wasn't just what they said, but how you presented it, how you structured it; you added humor, great description.  Just as a teacher, that's just A-plus work right there.  (Laughter.)       And it says it all.  I mean, those presentations are just a great representation of what this little project can do with kids.  They just eat up information and they take our lead, and they drink it up like nothing, and then they turn it around and teach us in the process.      It has been an honor to work with you all.  It has been an honor.  Each and every time you have come to the White House, you have come with graciousness, good manners, enthusiasm, energy.  Your parents should be very proud of you, as well as your teachers.  You have made it just so easy for us to work with you, and I am thrilled to be here in your garden.  And I'm going to do some planting, too, here.      So I want to thank you all for what you've done to help us get the garden started.  And Tammy, just to answer your questions, the garden is beautiful.  It is blooming, it is bursting.  We've already used about 80 pounds of lettuce.  We've eaten it, we served it at a big fancy luncheon that I did for other congressional and senate spouses, and they just raved over it.  And I told everybody about the work that you did to plant it, how you came back again and again, and how you're working in your own gardens.      So everything is going well.  We also shared some of the lettuce and some of the honey with Miriam's Kitchen, as well, so already the work that you're doing is not just feeding our family and the staff and our guests at the White House, but it's feeding people who may not have anything to eat.  So you all should know, when you come back to harvest in a couple of weeks, you will see a totally different garden.       Everything is blooming.  We even had to replant some more lettuce because we used it up so quickly.  But the beans are starting to sprout up.  We put the tomatoes in.  We've sent -- rhubarb.  We've had rhubarb pie.  If you guys have had rhubarb, it tastes just -- sort of like strawberry, and maybe Sam -- Mr. Sam -- (laughter) -- maybe we can do something with rhubarb, a nice sweet when you guys come back for the harvesting.           And we used a lot of the herbs, seasonings in our salads and in our foods, so we are using every single aspect of that garden.  And the tomatoes, hopefully, will be starting to come up, and some of the berries, as well.      So things are going well at the White House Garden, thanks to you all, and you should be proud of what you've done.       But this is exactly why I wanted to be a part of this project -- what we're seeing here.  Being able to share this with the Bancroft School has just been a special treat because as the students indicated in their presentation, it's not just about being out in the garden, being out in the open air, or being at the White House.  They've really learned some lessons about nutrition.  They're making different choices because they're a part of the process of planting and tilling the soil and pulling up the food.  It makes such a huge difference in the choices that they make.      So this is an example of why we wanted to do this, and I'm so happy that today some parents and community members have been able to join us to see just how much these kids have learned and how much they've embraced these concepts, because it's an example of what we can do nationally with kids and nutrition, because we have to have these conversations about nutrition in a society where we're seeing growing rates of obesity and diabetes among kids.  It is really about choices.      And one of the ways that I got involved in gardening and eating fresh foods is because I was a busy parent.  When we started this election, even before this campaign, you find that your schedule is so packed that it becomes difficult to figure out how to quickly and effectively feed your family.  So what do you resort to?  I know, it was take-out, it was processed foods, it was everything quick and easy.       And we started to see that taking a toll on our health.  And our children's pediatrician gave me a little tap on the shoulder and said, you might want to make some changes.  And the changes that we made were very simple.  We added more fruits and vegetables to our plates.  We eliminated processed foods.  We didn't say no to anything -- we still went out -- but it was just about moderation, and we were able to engage our children in the process of understanding what foods do to their bodies.      And like the kids at Bancroft, they ate up that information and they started schooling me and lecturing me about what I should be eating, and what a carrot does, and what broccoli does.  And sometimes they look at my plate in disgust now.  (Laughter.)  But what that just told me is that kids can lead the way for us, because we care about them so much.  I know I care about these kids as much as I care about my own.  And I wanted to share some of the lessons that I learned as a parent and the improvement that I saw in our overall family health with the rest of the nation, because it is difficult if you don't know about choices.           And we also know that access and affordability is also an important part of this conversation, which is why encouraging people to use farmer's markets, community gardens are really critical.  But we have to figure out how to make this more affordable.       And Bancroft School, this partnership has been right on track, because you've seen firsthand how possible it is to develop a community garden.  There were times, my mother reminded me, when there were victory gardens all over communities throughout this nation.  She talked about, as we went through this garden project -- it was like -- she just remembered that her mother -- you know, they had seven kids -- would get their fruits and vegetables from a victory garden in their neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago.  And that was one of the reasons why during some tough times with a big family and very little resources, they always had fruits and vegetables.  That was always something that was a part of their diet.  So part of what we need to do is reengage our communities in this kind of dialogue.       But we also need to think more broadly about the quality of the foods that we give our kids throughout -- what we're doing in our schools, in our school lunch programs -- because as the economy gets more troubled, there are going to be more and more kids who are going to qualify and rely on the meals that they get at schools, their breakfasts and their lunches.      And the next step -- or one of the next steps in this conversation is figuring out how do we ensure, through the help of the government, as well as local communities, that the foods that our kids are getting in school each and every day is as healthy as it can be, so that we're bringing some of these lessons home and we're also expanding them in the classrooms and in the schools.      So this has been just a wonderful kickoff.  And as you said, you think I've -- you've enjoyed the hugs and the kisses and the hugs and the sharing?  I've enjoyed that the most --  getting to know you guys, digging in the dirt, you know, just being out in the open air and watching your excitement -- because we did a lot of hard work moving that dirt with those shovels.  That was harder than I thought it was.  Remember we had to get the soil ready?  That was hard.  That stuff was heavy, wasn't it?      AUDIENCE:  Yes.      MRS. OBAMA:  But you guys didn't stop.  And I didn't think that we were going to finish planting everything.  I told Sam -- I said, well, we're going to -- when it was time to plant, I said, well, maybe we'll get through some of this, but we're going to run out of time.  But what did we do?       AUDIENCE:  Finish.      MRS. OBAMA:  You finished everything.  You guys planted every single thing in the White House Kitchen Garden.  You did everything, and you didn't stop until it was done.  And you should be proud of yourselves because I am so proud of you.       Thank you.  Thank you for being you guys, okay.  So let's go out and do some more planting.  (Applause.)                                          END                     2:23 P.M.

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
		ON THE MEETING OF THE P5+1 REGARDING IRAN

		Diplomatic Reception Room


		3:22 P.M. EDT

		THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Before I comment on today’s meeting in Geneva, I want to say a few words about the recent tragic events in the Pacific.

		On behalf of the American people, I want to once again extend my deepest condolences to the people of American Samoa and Samoa for the terrible loss of life and the devastation that took place after the recent earthquake and tsunami. I’ve spoken to the governor and delegate from American Samoa, and we continue to provide the full support of the federal government for relief efforts there.  I have also directed the State Department to provide the assistance necessary to help Samoa recover as well.

		We’re also deeply moved by the suffering and loss of life that’s been caused by the recent earthquake in West Sumatra.  And my administration has been in touch with the government of Indonesia to make it clear that the United States stands ready to help in this time of need, and I’ve ordered my administration to coordinate with the ongoing relief and recovery efforts there.

		Indonesia is an extraordinary country that’s known extraordinary hardship from natural disasters.  I know firsthand that the Indonesian people are strong and resilient and have the spirit to overcome this enormous challenge. And as they do, they need to know that America will be their friend and partner.

		Today, in Geneva, the United States –- along with our fellow permanent members of the UN Security Council -– namely, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom, as well as Germany -– held talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

		These meetings came after several months of intense diplomatic effort.  Upon taking office, I made it clear that the United States was prepared to join our P5-plus-1 partners as a full participant in talks with Iran.  I extended the offer of meaningful engagement to the Iranian government.  I committed the United States to a comprehensive effort to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear power –- provided that they live up to their international obligations.

		And we have engaged in intensive bilateral and multilateral diplomacy with our P5-plus-1 partners -- and with nations around the world –- to reinforce this point, including an historic U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed unanimously last week.

		The result is clear:  The P5-plus-1 is united, and we have an international community that has reaffirmed its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.  That’s why the Iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in Geneva:  Iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with regard to its nuclear program.

		In pursuit of that goal, today’s meeting was a constructive beginning, but it must be followed by constructive action by the Iranian government.

		First, Iran must demonstrate its commitment to transparency. Earlier this month, we presented clear evidence that Iran has been building a covert nuclear facility in Qom.  Since Iran has now agreed to cooperate fully and immediately with the International Atomic Energy Agency, it must grant unfettered access to IAEA inspectors within two weeks.  I’ve been in close touch with the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, who will be traveling to Tehran in the days ahead.  He has my full support, and the Iranian government must grant the IAEA full access to the site in Qom.

		Second, Iran must take concrete steps to build confidence that its nuclear program will serve peaceful purposes -- steps that meet Iran’s obligations under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.  The IAEA proposal that was agreed to in principle today with regard to the Tehran research reactor is a confidence-building step that is consistent with that objective -– provided that it transfers Iran’s low enriched uranium to a third country for fuel fabrication.  As I’ve said before, we support Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear power.  Taking the step of transferring its low enriched uranium to a third country would be a step towards building confidence that Iran’s program is in fact peaceful.

		Going forward, we expect to see swift action.  We’re committed to serious and meaningful engagement.  But we’re not interested in talking for the sake of talking.  If Iran does not take steps in the near future to live up to its obligations, then the United States will not continue to negotiate indefinitely, and we are prepared to move towards increased pressure.  If Iran takes concrete steps and lives up to its obligations, there is a path towards a better relationship with the United States, increased integration with the international community, and a better future for all Iranians.

		So let me reiterate:  This is a constructive beginning, but hard work lies ahead.  We’ve entered a phase of intensive international negotiations.  And talk is no substitute for action.  Pledges of cooperation must be fulfilled.  We have made it clear that we will do our part to engage the Iranian government on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect, but our patience is not unlimited.

		This is not about singling out Iran.  This is not about creating double standards.  This is about the global non-proliferation regime, and Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear energy, just as all nations have it -- but with that right, comes responsibilities.
		 
		The burden of meeting these responsibilities lies with the Iranian government, and they are now the ones that need to make that choice.

		Thank you very much.
