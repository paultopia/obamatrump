HOUSE</strong><br />  <br />  Office of the Press Secretary<br />  __________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />  For Immediate Release January 21, 2009<br />  <br />  <strong>REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN WELCOMING SENIOR STAFF AND CABINET SECRETARIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE </strong><br />  <br />  Room 450<br />  Eisenhower Executive Office Building<br />  <br />  1:18 P.M. EST<br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Please be seated. Still getting used to that whole thing. (Laughter.) Please be seated. Thank you so much. I wanted to get everyone together on the first day to welcome you to the White House. <br />  <br />  From our vantage point yesterday you couldn\\'t help but be inspired by the sight of Americans as far as the eye could see. They were there because they believe this is a moment of great change in America, a time for reinvigorating our democracy and remaking our country. They\\'ve entrusted all of us with a great responsibility. And so today I\\'d like to talk with you about our responsibility to keep that trust.<br />  <br />  In a few minutes I\\'m going to be issuing some of the first executive orders and directives of my presidency. And these steps are aimed at establishing firm rules of the road for my administration and all who serve in it, and to help restore that faith in government, without which we cannot deliver the changes we were sent here to make -- from rebuilding our economy and ensuring that anyone who is willing to work and find a well-paying job, to protecting and defending the United States, and promoting peace and security.<br />  <br />  However long we are keepers of the public trust we should never forget that we are here as public servants and public service is a privilege. It\\'s not about advantaging yourself. It\\'s not about advancing your friends or your corporate clients. It\\'s not about advancing an ideological agenda or the special interests of any organization. Public service is, simply and absolutely, about advancing the interests of Americans. <br />  <br />  The men and women in this room understand this, and that\\'s why you\\'re here. All of you are committed to building a more responsible, more accountable government. And part of what that means is making sure that we\\'re spending precious tax dollars wisely and cutting costs wherever possible.<br />  <br />  During this period of economic emergency, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington. And that\\'s why I\\'m instituting a pay freeze on the salaries of my senior White House staff. Some of the people in this room will be affected by the pay freeze, and I want you to know that I appreciate your willingness to agree to it, recognizing that it\\'s what\\'s required of you at this moment. It\\'s a mark of your commitment to public service.<br />  <br />  But the American people deserve more than simply an assurance that those who are coming to Washington will serve their interests. They also deserve to know that there are rules on the books to keep it that way. They deserve a government that is truly of, by, and for the people. As I often said during the campaign, we need to make the White House the people\\'s house. And we need to close the revolving door that lets lobbyists come into government freely, and lets them use their time in public service as a way to promote their own interests over the interests of the American people when they leave.<br />  <br />  So today we are taking a major step towards fulfilling this campaign promise. The executive order on ethics I will sign shortly represents a clean break from business as usual. As of today, lobbyists will be subject to stricter limits than under any other administration in history. If you are a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on, or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years. When you leave government, you will not be able to lobby my administration for as long as I am President. And there will be a ban on gifts by lobbyists to anyone serving in the administration, as well.<br />  <br />  Now, the new rules on lobbying alone, no matter how tough, are not enough to fix a broken system in Washington. That\\'s why I\\'m also setting new rules that govern not just lobbyists, but all those who have been selected to serve in my administration.<br />  <br />  If you are enlisting in government service, you will have to commit in writing to rules limiting your role for two years in matters involving people you used to work with, and barring you from any attempt to influence your former government colleagues for two years after you leave. And you will receive an ethics briefing on what is required of you to make sure that our government is serving the people\\'s interests, and nobody else\\'s -- a briefing, I\\'m proud to say, I was the first member of this administration to receive last week. <br />  <br />  But the way to make a government responsible is not simply to enlist the services of responsible men and women, or to sign laws that ensure that they never stray. The way to make government responsible is to hold it accountable. And the way to make government accountable is make it transparent so that the American people can know exactly what decisions are being made, how they\\'re being made, and whether their interests are being well served.<br />  <br />  The directives I am giving my administration today on how to interpret the Freedom of Information Act will do just that. For a long time now, there\\'s been too much secrecy in this city. The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known.<br />  <br />  To be sure, issues like personal privacy and national security must be treated with the care they demand. But the mere fact that you have the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should always use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and transparent, and of holding it accountable. And I expect members of my administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit of this law.<br />  <br />  I will also hold myself as President to a new standard of openness. Going forward, anytime the American people want to know something that I or a former President wants to withhold, we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution.<br />  <br />  Let me say it as simply as I can: Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.<br />  <br />  Our commitment to openness means more than simply informing the American people about how decisions are made. It means recognizing that government does not have all the answers, and that public officials need to draw on what citizens know. And that\\'s why, as of today, I\\'m directing members of my administration to find new ways of tapping the knowledge and experience of ordinary Americans -- scientists and civic leaders, educators and entrepreneurs -- because the way to solve the problem of our time is -- the way to solve the problems of our time, as one nation, is by involving the American people in shaping the policies that affect their lives.<br />  <br />  The executive orders and directives I\\'m issuing today will not by themselves make government as honest and transparent as it needs to be. And they do not go as far as we need to go towards restoring accountability and fiscal restraint in Washington. But these historic measures do mark the beginning of a new era of openness in our country. And I will, I hope, do something to make government trustworthy in the eyes of the American people in the days and weeks, months and years to come. That\\'s a pretty good place to start.<br />  <br />  Thank you very much. (Applause.)<br />  <br />  (The executive order and directives are signed.) (Applause.) <br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Lisa, our schedule now -- the swearing-in is going to be taking place, and the Vice President is going to be carrying that out? Okay. <br />  <br />  Before the Vice President does that, let me just say how proud I am of all of you. This is an extraordinary collection of talent, and you inspire great confidence in me. I think the more the American people get to know you, the more you will inspire great confidence in the American people. All of you have made extraordinary sacrifices to be here. Many of you have brought your families here; they\\'re making extraordinary sacrifices. <br />  <br />  But what a -- what a moment we\\'re in. What an opportunity we have to change this country. And for those of us who have been in public life before, these kinds of moments come around just every so often. The American people are really counting on us now. Let\\'s make sure we take advantage of it. I know you will. So thank you for your commitment. <br />  <br />  Joe, do you want to administer the oath?<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: Am I doing this again?<br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: For the senior staff.<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: For the senior staff, all right. <br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: Yes. A number of Cabinet members have already --<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: My memory is not as good as Justice Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts. (Laughter.) Okay, no, I -- this is the list. Do you have a copy of the oath? Which senior staff are we doing?<br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: A whole bunch of senior staff.<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. All of the senior staff -- <br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: Rise.<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- please rise. I will say &quot;aye,&quot; and then you repeat your name. <br />  <br />  THE PRESIDENT: Marvin, button up your coat. (Laughter.) <br />  <br />  (Senior staff are sworn in.)<br />  <br />  THE VICE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.<br />  <br />  Mr. President -- our senior staff. (Applause.)<br />  <br />  END 1:31 P.M.

EST   THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Please be seated. Still getting used to that whole thing. (Laughter.) Please be seated. Thank you so much. I wanted to get everyone together on the first day to welcome you to the White House.    From our vantage point yesterday you couldn\\'t help but be inspired by the sight of Americans as far as the eye could see. They were there because they believe this is a moment of great change in America, a time for reinvigorating our democracy and remaking our country. They\\'ve entrusted all of us with a great responsibility. And so today I\\'d like to talk with you about our responsibility to keep that trust.   In a few minutes I\\'m going to be issuing some of the first executive orders and directives of my presidency. And these steps are aimed at establishing firm rules of the road for my administration and all who serve in it, and to help restore that faith in government, without which we cannot deliver the changes we were sent here to make -- from rebuilding our economy and ensuring that anyone who is willing to work and find a well-paying job, to protecting and defending the United States, and promoting peace and security.   However long we are keepers of the public trust we should never forget that we are here as public servants and public service is a privilege. It\\'s not about advantaging yourself. It\\'s not about advancing your friends or your corporate clients. It\\'s not about advancing an ideological agenda or the special interests of any organization. Public service is, simply and absolutely, about advancing the interests of Americans.    The men and women in this room understand this, and that\\'s why you\\'re here. All of you are committed to building a more responsible, more accountable government. And part of what that means is making sure that we\\'re spending precious tax dollars wisely and cutting costs wherever possible.   During this period of economic emergency, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington. And that\\'s why I\\'m instituting a pay freeze on the salaries of my senior White House staff. Some of the people in this room will be affected by the pay freeze, and I want you to know that I appreciate your willingness to agree to it, recognizing that it\\'s what\\'s required of you at this moment. It\\'s a mark of your commitment to public service.   But the American people deserve more than simply an assurance that those who are coming to Washington will serve their interests. They also deserve to know that there are rules on the books to keep it that way. They deserve a government that is truly of, by, and for the people. As I often said during the campaign, we need to make the White House the people\\'s house. And we need to close the revolving door that lets lobbyists come into government freely, and lets them use their time in public service as a way to promote their own interests over the interests of the American people when they leave.   So today we are taking a major step towards fulfilling this campaign promise. The executive order on ethics I will sign shortly represents a clean break from business as usual. As of today, lobbyists will be subject to stricter limits than under any other administration in history. If you are a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on, or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years. When you leave government, you will not be able to lobby my administration for as long as I am President. And there will be a ban on gifts by lobbyists to anyone serving in the administration, as well.   Now, the new rules on lobbying alone, no matter how tough, are not enough to fix a broken system in Washington. That\\'s why I\\'m also setting new rules that govern not just lobbyists, but all those who have been selected to serve in my administration.   If you are enlisting in government service, you will have to commit in writing to rules limiting your role for two years in matters involving people you used to work with, and barring you from any attempt to influence your former government colleagues for two years after you leave. And you will receive an ethics briefing on what is required of you to make sure that our government is serving the people\\'s interests, and nobody else\\'s -- a briefing, I\\'m proud to say, I was the first member of this administration to receive last week.    But the way to make a government responsible is not simply to enlist the services of responsible men and women, or to sign laws that ensure that they never stray. The way to make government responsible is to hold it accountable. And the way to make government accountable is make it transparent so that the American people can know exactly what decisions are being made, how they\\'re being made, and whether their interests are being well served.   The directives I am giving my administration today on how to interpret the Freedom of Information Act will do just that. For a long time now, there\\'s been too much secrecy in this city. The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known.   To be sure, issues like personal privacy and national security must be treated with the care they demand. But the mere fact that you have the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should always use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and transparent, and of holding it accountable. And I expect members of my administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit of this law.   I will also hold myself as President to a new standard of openness. Going forward, anytime the American people want to know something that I or a former President wants to withhold, we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution.   Let me say it as simply as I can: Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.   Our commitment to openness means more than simply informing the American people about how decisions are made. It means recognizing that government does not have all the answers, and that public officials need to draw on what citizens know. And that\\'s why, as of today, I\\'m directing members of my administration to find new ways of tapping the knowledge and experience of ordinary Americans -- scientists and civic leaders, educators and entrepreneurs -- because the way to solve the problem of our time is -- the way to solve the problems of our time, as one nation, is by involving the American people in shaping the policies that affect their lives.   The executive orders and directives I\\'m issuing today will not by themselves make government as honest and transparent as it needs to be. And they do not go as far as we need to go towards restoring accountability and fiscal restraint in Washington. But these historic measures do mark the beginning of a new era of openness in our country. And I will, I hope, do something to make government trustworthy in the eyes of the American people in the days and weeks, months and years to come. That\\'s a pretty good place to start.   Thank you very much. (Applause.)   (The executive order and directives are signed.) (Applause.)    THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Lisa, our schedule now -- the swearing-in is going to be taking place, and the Vice President is going to be carrying that out? Okay.    Before the Vice President does that, let me just say how proud I am of all of you. This is an extraordinary collection of talent, and you inspire great confidence in me. I think the more the American people get to know you, the more you will inspire great confidence in the American people. All of you have made extraordinary sacrifices to be here. Many of you have brought your families here; they\\'re making extraordinary sacrifices.    But what a -- what a moment we\\'re in. What an opportunity we have to change this country. And for those of us who have been in public life before, these kinds of moments come around just every so often. The American people are really counting on us now. Let\\'s make sure we take advantage of it. I know you will. So thank you for your commitment.    Joe, do you want to administer the oath?   THE VICE PRESIDENT: Am I doing this again?   THE PRESIDENT: For the senior staff.   THE VICE PRESIDENT: For the senior staff, all right.    THE PRESIDENT: Yes. A number of Cabinet members have already --   THE VICE PRESIDENT: My memory is not as good as Justice Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts. (Laughter.) Okay, no, I -- this is the list. Do you have a copy of the oath? Which senior staff are we doing?   THE PRESIDENT: A whole bunch of senior staff.   THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. All of the senior staff --    THE PRESIDENT: Rise.   THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- please rise. I will say \"aye,\" and then you repeat your name.    THE PRESIDENT: Marvin, button up your coat. (Laughter.)    (Senior staff are sworn in.)   THE VICE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.   Mr. President -- our senior staff. (Applause.)   END 1:31 P.M. EST\\n\\n'"

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Thank you very much. \\xa0Today it's my distinct privilege to welcome to the White House three of the five living survivors of the USS Arizona. \\xa0This is their first time to our nation's capital -- Ken, Lauren, and Don. \\xa0I hope this trip does honor to you and your truly heroic service and we wanted to thank you all. \\xa0That is so good. \\xa0Thank you very much. \\xa0Thank you for giving me the nicest hardware, plus a beautiful patch. \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tFor these three World War II veterans, December 7th, 1941, the brutal attack on Pearl Harbor is forever seared into their memories. \\xa0It's also seared into America's memory because, on that grim day, this mighty nation was roused to defend freedom itself.\\n\\n\\tEach of them has a harrowing story of courage to share. \\xa0They tell us of the American spirit under fire, and of the will of our people to defeat threats to our nation and to the civilized world. \\xa0\\n\\n\\tOne of the heroes with us today is Ken Potts. \\xa0Ken was on the shore at Pearl Harbor when the attack began. \\xa0Rather than flee from the fire and the chaos, he drove his small boat into the blazing hot water. \\xa0He climbed aboard the sinking Arizona, and he carried off passengers one by one. \\xa0\\n\\n\\tKen, it is an honor to meet you, an American hero whose love of our country and love of his brothers was greater than his concern for his own safety. \\xa0And he paid a very big price. \\xa0He's gone through life in a little bit worse condition than he could have but he was very, very happy that he did it. \\xa0\\n\\n\\tWe're deeply grateful that you are here today with us nearly 76 years after that December morning. \\xa0You are a living witness to history and a living example of true American courage. \\xa0Ken, how are you doing? \\xa0Are you all right?\\n\\n\\tMR. POTTS: \\xa0All right.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0You doing good?\\n\\n\\tMR. POTTS: \\xa0Yes.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0You're feeling good?\\n\\n\\tMR. POTTS: \\xa0Yes.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0You better believe it. \\xa0(Laughter.) \\xa0He looks good to me. \\xa0Thank you very much. \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tLauren Bruner and Donald Stratton are also with us. \\xa0They were on the deck of the USS Arizona, doing their duty, when the ship was engulfed by massive, massive flames. \\xa0They were both fortunate enough to be rescued by another courageous hero, Joe George, whose daughter, Joe Ann, is with us today. \\xa0\\n\\n\\tJoe was in a boat next to the USS Arizona, and when he saw several men still standing, he hurled a rope onto the deck of the ship at tremendous risk to himself. \\xa0Lauren and Don clung to that rope and, hand over hand, they crossed through the 70 feet of flames, burning endlessly.\\n\\n\\tThe story of Lauren and Don's devotion and duty doesn't end there. \\xa0Despite suffering terrible burns, still with them today, they both served in the Navy for years after, fighting in some of the greatest Pacific engagements in World War II. \\xa0Lauren and Don, thank you very much for your lifetime of service and your lifetime of sacrifice. \\xa0Thank you very much. \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tMR. STRATTON: \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Feel pretty good, right? \\xa0How long have you been married? \\xa0Have long are you together? \\xa0Listen to this one, folks.\\n\\n\\tMR. STRATTON: \\xa0Sixty-seven years. \\xa0My wife.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0That's a long time. \\xa0That's beautiful. \\xa0That's beautiful. \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tMR. STRATTON: \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0That is beautiful.\\n\\n\\tAs Lauren and Don will tell you, they're here because one man, Joe George, stopped at nothing to save them. \\xa0Joe George rescued six men that day. \\xa0He is no longer with us, but he will always honor and remember a man -- we will always do this -- whose courage knew no limits. \\xa0His name will go down in history -- very brave, very strong.\\n\\n\\tJoe Ann, your father makes us all proud. \\xa0Thank you for inspiring our nation by telling the story of your father -- a true patriot; a well-known man; a man that goes down, really, in the history with the Arizona; and a total hero. \\xa0Thank you very much.\\n\\n\\tMS. TAYLOR: \\xa0We're very proud of him.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0You should be, right? \\xa0That's so nice. \\xa0Thank you for being here. \\xa0I think you loved him, right?\\n\\n\\tMS. TAYLOR: \\xa0I loved him very much. \\xa0And I know you understand because you have your daughters.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0I do.\\n\\n\\tMS. TAYLOR: \\xa0You understand the relationship.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0That's true. \\xa0Thank you, Joe Ann. \\xa0Appreciate it.\\n\\n\\tThere are many remarkable things that I witness as President, but nothing can take the place of meeting heroes like those with us today. \\xa0In them we see the strength of our nation, the courage of our men and women in uniform, the resolve to never accept failure, and the belief that justice will always triumph and that the America -- and the America that we know and love -- the United States -- will always prevail. \\xa0We will always prevail.\\n\\n\\tAnd by the way, we're building it up bigger -- you know this. \\xa0We're building it up bigger and stronger and better than ever before. \\xa0Our military is very proud again, aren't they? \\xa0\\n\\n\\tLIEUTENANT PREVITS: \\xa0That's right.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0You see what's happening.\\n\\n\\tLIEUTENANT PREVITS: \\xa0Indeed.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0They look at the day's budget, and so they're seeing lots of ships, right? \\xa0Lots of planes. \\xa0Lots of great equipment.\\n\\n\\tLIEUTENANT PREVITS: \\xa0Yes, sir.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Ken, Lauren, Don, and Joe Ann, I want to thank you for reminding us who we are, where we come from, and why we never, ever give up. \\xa0Your story gives us all inspiration to do the right thing for our country, our countrymen, and for our God. \\xa0Thank you very much for being here. \\xa0Thank you very much. \\xa0It's a great honor. \\xa0Thank you. \\xa0Thank you all.\\n\\n\\tQ \\xa0 \\xa0Mr. President, what are you trying to accomplish with your staff shakeups today? \\xa0Can you explain to us what you're trying to accomplish?\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Make America great again.\\n\\n\\tYou want to hear this, fellas? \\xa0It's very interesting. \\xa0Very interesting. \\xa0Very beautiful statement. \\xa0Very beautiful statement.\\n\\n\\tMR. STRATTON: \\xa0All the people we met today and all the people who were lined along -- that we've been with, you could tell, with our military and everything, that this country is coming together again, and we're going to be there.\\n\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0That's good. \\xa0And now I know why you married this guy such a long time. \\xa0(Laughter.) \\xa0That's beautiful. \\xa0Thank you.\\n\\n\\tI could never have said it that well, believe me. \\xa0(Laughter.) \\xa0Believe me. \\xa0Thank you. \\xa0That's so nice.\\n\\n\\tEND\\xa0\\n\\t2:59 P.M.

EST   THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. We had a very constructive meeting with the House members, members of the Republican Caucus. I'm a little bit late for my Senate colleagues -- former Senate colleagues.   And the main message I have is that the statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation. The American people expect action. They want us to put together a recovery package that puts people back to work, that creates investments that assure our long-term energy independence, an effective health care system, an education system that works; they want our infrastructure rebuilt, and they want it done wisely, so that we're not wasting taxpayer money.   As I explained to the Republican House Caucus, and I'll explain to my former Senate colleagues, the recovery package that we have proposed and is moving its way through Congress is just one leg in a multi-legged stool. We're still going to have to have much better financial regulation, we've got to get credit flowing again, we're going to have to deal with the troubled assets that many banks are still carrying and that make the -- that have locked up the credit system. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries, because we now have a global problem.   I am absolutely confident that we can deal with these issues, but the key right now is to make sure that we keep politics to a minimum. There are some legitimate philosophical differences with parts of my plan that the Republicans have, and I respect that. In some cases they may just not be as familiar with what's in the package as I would like. I don't expect a hundred percent agreement from my Republican colleagues, but I do hope that we can all put politics aside and do the American people's business right now. All right.   END 1:43 P.M.

EDT\\n\\n\\tTHE VICE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Hello, CUFI! \\xa0(Applause.) \\xa0Thank you, Pastor John Hagee, Ambassador Dermer, distinguished members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow believers and friends, it is humbling for me to be before you today to join you at the 12th annual summit of the largest pro-Israel organization in the United States of America -- Christians United for Israel! \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tIt’s great to be back with so many friends. \\xa0And to all of you -- I bring greetings from another friend. \\xa0I just left him a few moments ago. \\xa0He is a leader, a believer, and a tireless friend of the Jewish state of Israel -- the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThanks to the support of so many in this room and your prayers, last November President Trump won a historic victory -- more counties than any President since Ronald Reagan, 30 of 50 states -- no Republican had carried in a generation. \\xa0The truth is President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red, and you made it happen. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tNow as the Good Book says: If you owe debts, pay debts. \\xa0If honor, then honor. \\xa0If respect, then respect. \\xa0And I’m really here on the President’s behalf and on our entire team’s behalf to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every single day to defend faith, restore freedom, and strengthen America’s unbreakable bond with our most cherished ally, Israel. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tJust last month, President Trump made a historic visit to Israel. \\xa0I know all of you were watching from afar. \\xa0One of the very first countries our President visited since he took office, standing in Jerusalem, in that ancient and holy city, our President declared for all the world to hear that under his leadership, the United States of America “will always stand with Israel.” \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tIn Jerusalem, our President said that the bond between America and Israel in his words “is woven together in the hearts of our people” -- and Christians United for Israel proves this statement true every single day all across this country.\\n\\n\\tYou know, it was only 11 years ago that my friend Pastor John Hagee had the courage and the vision to unite American Christians to rally around those ancient words “for Zion’s sake, I will not keep silent.” \\xa0And, Pastor John Hagee, I thank you for your leadership on behalf of this nation and the Jewish state of Israel. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd today, through Christians United for Israel, more than 3.3 million believers have raised their voices, have not been silent in support of Israel, and you can be heard in every city and town across America and in every office on Capitol Hill. \\xa0And rest assured, the man down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue hears you, too. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tNow for my part, Karen and I have always treasured our relationship with Christians United for Israel. \\xa0I had the honor to speak to this great group when I was a member of Congress. \\xa0I worked hand-in-hand with CUFI when I was governor of the state of Indiana. \\xa0And with the support and prayers of men and women gathered in this room, I’m proud to say in my last year as governor, it was my great privilege to sign one of the strongest anti-BDS laws in the America to ensure that our state never does business with those who seek to inflict financial damage on Israel. \\xa0(Applause.) \\xa0Because boycott, divestment, and sanctions have no place in my home state and no place in America. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tIt’s humbling to stand before you today for another reason because it was just one year ago this past weekend that the phone rang at the governor’s residence, and there was a familiar voice on other line. \\xa0And I remember when that call came and when the invitation came to join this national ticket, I couldn’t help but think of that ancient verses: \\xa0Who am I and who is my family, that you’ve brought me this far?\\xa0\\n\\n\\tSo tonight, let me just take a moment to thank all of you men and women of CUFI, and all those you represent around America, thank you for your friendship, your support, and your prayers every step of the way on the journey my little family has taken throughout my career. \\xa0It’s hard for me to express before you friends of so many years the humility and gratitude I feel today to stand before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. \\xa0From the bottom of my heart, thank you. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tMy friends, to look at Israel is to see that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob keeps his promises, keeps the promises He makes to His people and to each one of us.\\n\\n\\tEzekiel prophesized: \\xa0“Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.” \\xa0And the State of Israel and her people bear witness to God’s faithfulness, as well as their own.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tHow unlikely was Israel’s birth, how more unlikely has been her survival, and how confounding, against the odds, has been her thriving.\\n\\n\\tSince the moment of their independence, the Jewish people have awed the world with their strength of will and their strength of character.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tIndeed, anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear must acknowledge that Israel is a living testimony to the power of hope over hate and so will she always be. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThe Jewish people have turned the desert into a garden, sickness into health, scarcity into plenty, despair into hope, and slander into blessings -- rebuking all who condemn them; not for what they do wrong, but for what they do right.\\n\\n\\tAnd under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: \\xa0America stands with Israel. \\xa0Now and always. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tPresident Trump and I stand with Israel for the same reason every freedom-loving American stands with Israel -- because her cause is our cause, her values are our values, and her fight is our fight.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd President Trump is actually a lifelong friend of Israel. \\xa0I’ve seen his passion firsthand in the President’s deep affection for Israel. \\xa0The morning after the election, I was actually in the room when Prime Minister Netanyahu called to congratulate the President on his great victory. \\xa0I heard President Trump express his unwavering support for Israel and the Jewish people that morning, support he reiterated when he welcomed the Prime Minister to the White House.\\n\\n\\tAnd just last month, the world saw our President’s commitment to Israel during that visit to Jerusalem, when President Donald Trump declared that America’s “deep and lasting friendship” with Israel will only in his words “grow deeper and stronger as we work together in the days ahead.” \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tFor my part, like all of you, my passion for Israel springs from my Christian faith. \\xa0The songs of the land and the people of Israel were the anthems of my youth. \\xa0As for me and my house, we pray for the peace of Jerusalem and all who call her home. \\xa0It’s really the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply for our most cherished ally.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd let me say with confidence to all gathered here and to all of the watching world, President Trump and I stand without apology for Israel today. \\xa0We will stand without apology for Israel tomorrow, and President Donald Trump and I will stand with the Israel always -- of that you may be assured. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tYou just need to look at the actions our President has taken since he took office. \\xa0Like when he named Governor Nikki Haley to be America’s Ambassador to the United Nations. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAt the President’s direction, Ambassador Haley has been standing up for America and she’s been standing up for Israel. \\xa0And as Ambassador Haley said just a short while ago, in her words, “The days of Israel-bashing at the United Nations are over.” \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd the President also named David Friedman to represent our country in Israel as our ambassador. \\xa0David is an unabashed advocate for a stronger America-Israel relationship, and our friendship is already stronger with him in our embassy in Israel.\\n\\n\\tAnd to the men and women of Christians United for Israel, this President hears you. \\xa0This President stands with you. \\xa0And I promise you that the day will come when President Donald Trump moves the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \\xa0It is not a question of if, it is only when. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tPresident Trump is also personally committed to helping the parties resolve the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \\xa0In addition to his own visit to Israel, the President has dispatched several of his top advisors to help guide negotiations. \\xa0But our President I can assure knows any peace requires an end to the incitement of hatred, an end to any support whatsoever of terrorism. \\xa0And above all else, a lasting peace requires true and complete Palestinian willingness to accept and recognize the Jewish state of Israel. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd while there will undoubtedly have to be compromises, let me assure all of you gathered here today, President Donald Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish state of Israel -- not now, not ever. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tSince the moment of its birth, there has hardly been a day when Israelis have lived without war, or the fear of war, or the grim reality of terror. \\xa0We were reminded of this just last Friday, when three gunmen ambushed a group of Israeli police officers in the very heart of Jerusalem. \\xa0Two brave officers were murdered in this barbaric act of terrorism. \\xa0We mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve. \\xa0We grieve with the families of these fallen heroes of Israel, and the prayers of our President, our family, and all who cherish Israel are with these heroic law enforcement officers and their families. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd so is our resolve. \\xa0President Trump has made it clear: America stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel, as together we confront those enemies who threaten our people, our freedom, and our very way of life.\\n\\n\\tAmerica and Israel are united together as friends and allies in the West. \\xa0Just a few weeks ago, in Warsaw, Poland -- home to so much Jewish history, and so much Jewish heartache, our President defined our struggle with moral clarity, courage, and vision more than any President since Ronald Reagan when President Trump declared in his words: \\xa0“The West will never, ever be broken. \\xa0Our values will prevail. \\xa0Our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.” \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWe will triumph because our courage and conviction cannot be matched, and for that matter, neither can our strength.\\n\\n\\tToday, America’s support for Israel’s security is at record levels. \\xa0And America now has a President who is fighting every day to rebuild our military.\\n\\n\\tAnd under President Donald Trump I promise you we're going to rebuild this military. \\xa0We're going to restore the arsenal of democracy. \\xa0And we're once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need and deserve to accomplish their mission and come home safe. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tIn President Trump, America once again has a leader who will stand with our allies and stand up to our enemies. \\xa0And this President calls our enemies by their name. \\xa0And at this very moment I’m proud to report, the Armed Forces of the United States of America are taking the fight to ISIS terrorist on our terms and on their soil. \\xa0And under this Commander-in-Chief, we will continue to fight ISIS until we wipe them off the face of the Earth. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd under President Trump America will continue to stand strong, continue to stand strong in the face of the leading state sponsor of terrorism. \\xa0President Trump has put Iran on notice: \\xa0America will no longer tolerate Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel’s security.\\n\\n\\tAnd let me be clear on this point: \\xa0Under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a useable nuclear weapon. \\xa0This is our solemn promise to the American people, to the people of Israel, and to the world. \\xa0(Applause.) \\xa0\\n\\n\\tSo we stand with Israel. \\xa0We stand with Israel today and every day, because the American people throughout our history have always cherished Israel.\\n\\n\\tWe stand with Israel because our bond was knit millennia ago in the finery of faith. \\xa0And we stand with Israel because millions of Americans throughout the generations of this country have embraced that ancient truth and admonition that He will bless those who bless her, and he will curse those who curse her.\\n\\n\\tIndeed, though Israel was built by human hands, it is impossible not to sense that just beneath its history, lies the hand of heaven. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tOver the mantle of our home, since the year I was first elected to Congress, are framed words that have long inspired my family. \\xa0We had them over the fireplace in our home in a small town in southern Indiana. \\xa0We had them over the fireplace at the governor’s residence in Indianapolis, and now they hang over the mantle of the home of the Vice President of the United States.\\n\\n\\tThey're words of confidence and faith. \\xa0They're words to which my family has repaired to as generations of Americans have done so throughout our history, and the people of Israel through all their storied history have clung. \\xa0They come from the Book of Jeremiah, and it simply reads: \\xa0“For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.”\\n\\n\\tThese words are as true today for all people of faith as they were in millennia past. \\xa0And so I encourage you to embrace them. \\xa0I urge the men and women of Christians United for Israel to cling to that hope and that promise, and I urge you to do particularly what you’ve done exceedingly well these many years, to continue to bow the head, to bend the knee, and to pray. \\xa0Pray for our most cherished ally. \\xa0Pray for the peace of Jerusalem and pray that God will continue to bless America.\\n\\n\\tAnd when you pray, pray with confidence because our God is a faithful God, and He will guide us, and He will guard us as we go forth and do His work. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAnd so I thank you for the honor of joining you once again in this new capacity. \\xa0And I close tonight saying simply from my heart as I look out on this shining crowd, and I see the support that you represent all across this country for our most cherished ally. \\xa0And I have faith. \\xa0I have faith that with God’s help and with the men and women gathered here, with all those who cherish Israel, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, the best days for Israel and for America together are yet to come. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThank you. \\xa0God bless you. \\xa0God bless the Jewish state of Israel and God bless the United States of America. \\xa0(Applause.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\tEND\\n\\t9:12 P.M. EDT\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"}\n"

EST\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Well, I want to welcome, for the second day in a row, Prime Minister Reinfeldt.\\xa0 I also want to recognize President Barroso and Javier Solana.\\xa0 These three gentlemen obviously represent the leadership and the increasing integration -- successful integration that's been taking place in Europe.\\nI congratulated them on the conclusion of the Lisbon Treaty, which will further move Europe in the direction of integration not only on economic policy but also on a number of security issues.\\xa0 I believe that a strengthened and renewed EU will be an even better transatlantic partner with the United States.\\xa0 And so we are extraordinarily appreciative and supportive of the efforts that they've made and the leadership of these three gentlemen.\\nOur discussions today built on my April meeting with all 27 EU leaders in Prague.\\xa0 We discussed our shared commitment to success in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where EU civilian assistance has played an absolutely critical role.\\xa0\\nWe discussed climate change extensively, and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the Copenhagen meeting to assure that we create a framework for progress in dealing with what is a potential ecologic disaster.\\nWe discussed the situation in Iran and emphasized how important it is for the United States and the European Union to coordinate carefully and closely in sending a clear message to Tehran that we want them to be a full member of the community of nations, but that they have to act consistent with international rules and responsibilities with respect to their nuclear program.\\nWe reaffirmed our commitment to strong, sustained economic growth that was articulated by the G20 in Pittsburgh, and reaffirmed our intent to continue to expand trade and resist protectionist measures between the United States and the European Union.\\nAnd we spoke about how we can actually coordinate more effectively in preventing terrorism from spreading between our various countries.\\xa0 We also had a discussion about the Middle East and how we can work together closely on that front.\\nOver all, I want to say a special congratulations to President Barroso, who's been reelected for another five-year term.\\xa0 He has done an excellent job in his role with the Commission.\\xa0 And I want to thank Fredrik for the leadership that he's shown on a wide range of issues, not just within Europe but around the globe as well.\\xa0 Javier has been a critical partner with us in dealing with the Iran issue.\\nSo these three gentlemen have shown global leadership.\\xa0 I'm glad they had a chance to visit the United States, and I'm absolutely committed to continuing to strengthen the transatlantic partnership that this meeting represents.\\nPRIME MINISTER REINFELDT:\\xa0 Well, thank you very much, Barack.\\xa0 Thank you for the hospitality.\\xa0 This is also very important for Europe to value this trust, cooperation with the United States, and since we share the same values.\\xa0 And I think we had a very good meeting.\\xa0\\nWe had at length a discussion about climate change.\\xa0 And I want to say that we need an agreement that can deliver on the 2-degree target that could give us a solution on financing and that is global and that keeps -- puts everyone together.\\xa0 That is what we need to see.\\nAnd I want to say that I think President Obama has shown real leadership on this issue.\\xa0 When we talk to people here in the United States they all come back to this, that President Obama himself is very committed.\\xa0 He has great knowledge in this item and we have great hopes for your leadership in this issue.\\nWhen it comes to Afghanistan, we also have a close partnership in Afghanistan.\\xa0 We have a huge representation also on European Union side; we have 35,000 troopers there and more than a billion euros a year that we actually invest in development resources given to Afghanistan.\\xa0 So of course we need to have a close working relation when it comes to finding a way for Afghani ownership of the development in Afghanistan.\\nWe actually have also delivered on four points.\\xa0 We have a start on cooperating on energy and launched an EU-U.S. ministerial energy council.\\xa0 Our foreign energy ministers will have their first meeting tomorrow, which we welcome.\\xa0 Secondly, we intensify our cooperation and dialogue on transatlantic economic integration in order to reduce the barriers of trade.\\nThird, deliverance is restored on dialogue and development on global food security, climate change litigation, and the Millennium Development Goals; and last, to intensify the EU-U.S. cooperation on anti-microbio resistance.\\xa0 So we are very glad for all of these deliverances as well.\\nThank you.\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Excellent.\\nPRESIDENT BARROSO:\\xa0 I think President Obama and Prime Minister Reinfeldt already made the most important points regarding this very productive meeting we just had.\\xa0 I'd like to thank President Obama for his very kind words to the European Union.\\xa0 In fact, we believe that is more important than ever, this relationship.\\nIn this age of globalization it is quite obvious that the United States and Europe can make a real difference.\\xa0 There are so many issues on the global agenda, from climate change to financial and economic cooperation, to trade -- many issues that we have discussed today.\\nRegarding climate change I want to tell that I am more confident now than I was in days before.\\xa0 The Copenhagen -- this issue has been slow, but I would like once again to pay tribute to President Obama's leadership.\\xa0 As I said earlier, President Obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations because with the strong leadership of United States we can indeed make an agreement.\\xa0 We are working toward a framework agreement in Copenhagen that will be an important agreement for the world.\\nAnd we had particularly a very good discussion on this today and I think it was one of the most important points of our exchange.\\xa0\\nOf course I want to repeat what President Obama and Prime Minister Reinfeldt just said, it is extremely important on the other issues like Afghanistan and Pakistan and the issue of global security also we work together, now negotiating it with the Lisbon Treaty -- the Lisbon Treaty, the treaty that we will give the European Union a reinforced capacity to act, a more clear position also, externally working with our main partners, and of course working especially with our American friends.\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Javier.\\nPRESIDENT SOLANA:\\xa0 I have nothing to add, Mr. President. (Laughter.)\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you very much for your hospitality.\\xa0 We appreciate it.\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Well, thank you very much.\\xa0 You should understand that the rule in Washington is even if you don't have anything to say -- (laughter) -- you should take a long time to say it.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 So obviously we'll have to give you more training.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nThank you very much, everybody.\\nEND\\n\\t4:19 P.M.

MDT THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Hello, Grand Junction!\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Thank you so much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Everybody please have a seat.\\xa0 It is good to be back in Southwest Colorado.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Last time I was here I had some really good peaches.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 Somehow, though, Michelle and the girls got to go pick peaches -- and I\\'m hoping they bring some back for me. It is nice to take a break from the back and forth in Washington.\\xa0 I want to especially want to thank Nathan for his introduction and sharing his story.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 It\\'s not easy to talk about an illness in the family.\\xa0 It\\'s not easy to talk about such a painful experience.\\xa0 Because it\\'s important that we understand what\\'s at stake in this health care debate he\\'s been willing to share it with us.\\xa0 And so I\\'m very grateful to him. We\\'ve got a couple of other special guests that I want to acknowledge.\\xa0 First of all, I stole him from you to make him what I believe will be the best Secretary of the Interior in the history of the United States, Ken Salazar.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 But I left things in good hands with the outstanding congressman and brother of Ken, John Salazar.\\xa0 (Applause.) Your outstanding governor of this great state, Bill Ritter, is here.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 As well as the extraordinary First Lady of the state, Jeannie Ritter is here as well.\\xa0 (Applause.) Two of the finest young senators that we\\'ve got in Washington right now:\\xa0 Senator Mark Udall.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And Senator Michael Bennet.\\xa0 (Applause.) I want to thank the hospitality of Grand Junction Mayor Bruce Hill.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And finally I want to thank Tillie Bishop for the invocation.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And I want to thank the Central High students Elise Beckstead, Crystal Rossman, Axel Urie and Amelia LyBarger for their National Anthem and Pledge of Allegiance.\\xa0 Thank you, guys.\\xa0 (Applause.) Oh, and Central High principal Jody Diers is here.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And it turns out school starts in two days.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 You know, when I was going to school we always had until Labor Day.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 It\\'s rough for kids these days.\\xa0 But it\\'s important for us to be able to compete internationally, so it\\'s great to see dedicated educators like we have here at Central High.\\xa0 (Applause.) You know, Nathan\\'s story is the kind of story that I\\'ve read in letters and heard in town halls all across America.\\xa0 And on Tuesday I was in New Hampshire talking about people denied coverage because of preexisting conditions.\\xa0 Yesterday, I was in Montana talking about people who\\'ve had their insurance policies suddenly revoked, even though they were paying their premiums, just because they got sick.\\xa0 Today we\\'re talking about people like Nathan and his family who have insurance but are still stuck with huge bills because they\\'ve hit a cap on their benefits or they\\'re charged exorbitant out-of-pocket fees. And when you hear about these experiences, when you think about the millions of people denied coverage because of preexisting conditions and the thousands who have their policies cancelled because of an illness, the countless people like Nathan, I want you to remember one thing:\\xa0 There but for the grace of God go I.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 This is something that sometimes we\\'ve forgotten during the course of this health care debate.\\xa0 These are ordinary Americans.\\xa0 They\\'re no different from anybody else.\\xa0 They\\'re working hard, they\\'re meeting their responsibilities, but they\\'re held hostage by health insurance companies that deny them coverage, or drop their coverage, or charge fees that they can\\'t afford for care that they desperately need. It\\'s hurting too many families and businesses.\\xa0 It\\'s wrong.\\xa0 And we\\'re going to fix it when we pass health insurance reform this year.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now, this is obviously a tough time for the families in Colorado and all across America.\\xa0 I just want to rewind the clock a little bit, because sometimes people have forgotten what\\'s transpired over the last seven, eight months.\\xa0 Just six months ago, we were in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes.\\xa0 We were losing about 700,000 jobs each month.\\xa0 Economists from the left and the right, liberals and conservatives, feared the second coming of the Great Depression.\\xa0 I don\\'t know if everybody remembers that.\\xa0 That was six months ago.\\xa0 That\\'s why we acted as fast as we could to pass a recovery plan to stop the freefall.\\xa0 And there\\'s been a lot of misinformation about that, so let me just talk briefly about what it is that we did. The recovery plan was divided into three parts.\\xa0 One-third of the money -- one-third of the money in the Recovery Act, the stimulus plan -- went to tax cuts that are already showing up in the paychecks of nearly 2 million working families in Colorado, including right here in Grand Junction.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 So I just want everybody to be clear:\\xa0 One-third of it, tax cuts -- not tax increases -- more money in your pockets to spend as you wish. We also cut taxes for small businesses on the investments that they make, and hundreds of Colorado small businesses have qualified for new loans backed by the Recovery Act -- including 11 businesses in Grand Junction alone.\\xa0 (Applause.) So that was one-third of it. Now, another third of the money in the Recovery Act is for emergency relief for folks who\\'ve borne the brunt of this recession.\\xa0 So we\\'ve extended unemployment benefits for more than 150,000 Colorado citizens.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We\\'ve made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who are having to use COBRA because they lost their jobs and they\\'re out there looking for work.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And for states facing historic budget shortfalls, we provided assistance that has saved the jobs of tens of thousands of workers who provide essential services, like teachers and police officers.\\xa0 And Governor Ritter will tell you, if we had not had some of that money in, then Colorado would have had to make much more painful job cuts in vital services and might have had to put in place some very painful state and local tax increases.\\xa0 So that was the second third of the Recovery Act. Now, the last third of the Recovery Act is for investments that are already putting people back to work.\\xa0 There are almost 100 shovel-ready transportation projects already approved in Colorado which are beginning to create jobs.\\xa0 Not far from here, for example, there\\'s a project to pave and add lanes to State Highway 92.\\xa0 Most of the work is being done by local businesses, because that\\'s how we\\'re going to create jobs and grow this economy again. And by next month, projects will be underway at more than 100 national parks all over America, including Colorado.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Now these are -- these are projects restoring trails, improving infrastructure, making park facilities more energy efficient.\\xa0 Earlier today, some of you may know, I toured Yellowstone with Michelle and the girls.\\xa0 We saw Old Faithful -- I hadn\\'t seen it since I was 11 years old.\\xa0 It\\'s still going strong.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 Tomorrow we\\'re going to be visiting the Grand Canyon. And I recently signed into law a public lands bill that designates the Dominguez-Escalante Canyon as a National Conservation Area here in Colorado.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 These are national treasures -- symbols of how much we owe to those who came before us, and the fact that we\\'re borrowing this earth from those who will follow us.\\xa0 And I want to thank especially Ken Salazar, because he\\'s been leading the way on these vital issues, especially in the West.\\xa0 (Applause.) As we grapple with enormous challenges -- like health care -- the work of generations past reminds us of our duty to generations yet to come. So there is no doubt that the recovery plan is doing what we said it would:\\xa0 putting us on the road to recovery.\\xa0 It\\'s not solving all problems.\\xa0 Unemployment is still way too high.\\xa0 But we just saw last week that the jobs picture is beginning to turn.\\xa0 We\\'re starting to see signs that business investment is coming back.\\xa0 But that doesn\\'t mean we\\'re out of the woods.\\xa0 Even before this extraordinary financial crisis we had an economy that was working pretty well for the wealthiest Americans -- working pretty well for Wall Street bankers, for big corporations -- but it wasn\\'t working so well for everybody else.\\xa0 It was an economy of bubbles and busts.\\xa0 It was an economy in which the average worker, their wages and incomes had flatlined for a decade.\\xa0 It was an economy that rewarded recklessness over responsibility.\\xa0 So we can\\'t go back to that kind of economy. If we want this country to succeed in the 21st century, we\\'ve got to lay a new foundation for lasting prosperity.\\xa0 And health insurance reform is a key pillar of this new foundation.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Because this economy -- this economy won\\'t work for everyone until folks like Nathan and his family aren\\'t pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by medical expenses; until companies aren\\'t slashing payrolls and losing profits to pay for health insurance; until every single American has the security and peace of mind of quality, affordable health care. And health care touches us all in profound ways -- which by the way means that it\\'s only natural this debate is going to be an emotional one.\\xa0 There\\'s a lot at stake.\\xa0 And I know there\\'s been a lot of attention paid to some of the town hall meetings that are going on around the country -- especially those where tempers have flared, and TV really likes that.\\xa0 You can have 20 really great town hall meetings, and if there\\'s one where somebody loses their temper, that\\'s the one TV wants to cover. What you haven\\'t been seeing are the constructive meetings going on all over the country.\\xa0 That doesn\\'t mean people agree with me on every single issue, but it means that we\\'ve been trying to figure out how do we solve what we know is an unsustainable problem in our health care system.\\xa0 (Applause.) So just yesterday -- just yesterday I held a town hall in Belgrade, Montana, and we had a pretty good crowd.\\xa0 Some were big supporters of reform.\\xa0 Some had concerns and questions.\\xa0 Some were completely skeptical.\\xa0 And I got tough questions.\\xa0 But even though Montanans have strong opinions, they didn\\'t shout at one another.\\xa0 They were there to listen.\\xa0 And that reflects the American people and what our democracy is about, a lot more than what\\'s been covered on TV these last few days.\\xa0 And that\\'s why I thank all of you, whether you\\'re for or against health care reform, for being here today.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now, I\\'m going to take a bunch of questions, but before I do, I want to just talk about what health insurance reform will mean for you, because there\\'s a lot of misunderstandings out there. First of all, what we\\'re proposing is a common-sense set of consumer protections for people with health insurance, people with private insurance.\\xa0 I expect that after reform passes, the vast majority of Americans are still going to be getting their insurance from private insurers.\\xa0 So we\\'ve got to have some protections in place for people like Nathan, people like you. So insurance companies will no longer be able to place an arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive or charge outrageous out-of-pocket expenses on top of your premiums.\\xa0 That\\'s what happened to Nathan and his wife.\\xa0 Their son was diagnosed with hemophilia when he was born.\\xa0 The insurance company then raised the premiums for his family and for all his coworkers who were on the same policy.\\xa0 The family was approaching their cap. And so on top of worrying about taking care of their son, they had the added worry of trying to find insurance that would cover him -- plus thousands and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs.\\xa0 Nathan and his wife even considered getting a divorce so that she might possibly go on Medicaid. Now thankfully, Colorado\\'s law doesn\\'t allow coverage for small businesses to permanently exclude preexisting conditions like his son\\'s, so eventually they found insurance.\\xa0 But they\\'re paying increasing premiums and they still have to face the prospect of hitting their new cap in the next few years. Those are the stories I hear all over the country.\\xa0 I heard from a teenager in Indiana diagnosed with leukemia.\\xa0 The chemotherapy and intensive care he received cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\xa0 His family hit their lifetime cap in less than a year.\\xa0 They had insurance.\\xa0 So the insurance wouldn\\'t cover a bone marrow transplant and the family couldn\\'t afford all the money that was needed.\\xa0 The family turned to the public for help, but the boy died before he could receive that transplant. If you think that can\\'t happen to you or your family, think again.\\xa0 Almost 90 percent of individual health insurance policies have lifetime benefit limits.\\xa0 And about a third of family plans in the individual insurance market have lifetime limits under $3 million.\\xa0 If you or your spouse or your child gets sick and you hit that limit, it\\'s suddenly like you have no insurance at all. And this is part of a larger story, of folks with insurance, paying more and more out of pocket.\\xa0 In the past few years, premiums have nearly doubled for the average American family.\\xa0 Total out-of-pocket costs have increased by almost 50 percent -- that\\'s more than $2,000 per person.\\xa0 And nobody is holding these insurance companies accountable for these practices.\\xa0 And by the way, your employer is paying even more, and you may not even see the costs of it except for the fact that\\'s why you\\'re not getting a raise -- (applause) -- because it\\'s going into your health care instead of your salary and income. So we\\'re going to ban arbitrary caps on benefits.\\xa0 We\\'ll place limits on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses.\\xa0 No one in America should go broke because they get sick.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now, insurance companies will also be stopped from cancelling your coverage because you get sick or denying coverage because of your medical history.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Again, if you think this has nothing to do with you, think again.\\xa0 A recent report found that in the past few years, more than 12 million Americans were discriminated against by insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.\\xa0 When we get health insurance reform, those days will be over.\\xa0 And we will require insurance companies to cover routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies.\\xa0 That saves money; it saves lives.\\xa0 (Applause.) At the same time -- I just want to be completely clear about this; I keep on saying this but somehow folks aren\\'t listening -- if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan.\\xa0 Nobody is going to force you to leave your health care plan.\\xa0 If you like your doctor, you keep seeing your doctor.\\xa0 I don\\'t want government bureaucrats meddling in your health care.\\xa0 But the point is, I don\\'t want insurance company bureaucrats meddling in your health care either.\\xa0 (Applause.) So just to recap here, if you\\'re one of nearly 46 million people who don\\'t have health insurance, you will finally have quality, affordable options.\\xa0 If you do have health insurance, we will help make that insurance more affordable and more secure.\\xa0 Under the reform proposals that we\\'ve put out there, roughly 700,000 middle-class Coloradans will get a health care tax credit.\\xa0 More than a million Coloradans will have access to a new marketplace where you can easily compare health insurance options; 87,000 small businesses in Colorado will be aided by new tax benefits, so when they\\'re doing the right thing for their employees, they\\'re not penalized for it.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And we will do all of this without adding to our deficit over the next decade, largely by cutting waste and ending sweetheart deals for insurance companies that don\\'t make anybody any healthier.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now here -- if you don\\'t -- I know there\\'s some skepticism:\\xa0 Well, how are you going to save money in the health care system?\\xa0 You\\'re doing it here in Grand Junction.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 You know -- you know that lowering costs is possible if you put in place smarter incentives; if you think about how to treat people, not just illnesses; if you look at problems facing not just one hospital or physician, but the many system-wide problems that are shared.\\xa0 That\\'s what the medical community in this city did, and now you\\'re getting better results while wasting less money.\\xa0 And I know that your senator, Michael Bennet, has been working hard on legislation that\\'s based on putting the innovations that are here in Grand Junction into practice across the system, and there\\'s no reason why we can\\'t do that.\\xa0 (Applause.) So the fact is, we are closer to achieving reform than we\\'ve ever been.\\xa0 We have the American Nurses Association, we have the American Medical Association on board, because America\\'s doctors and nurses know how badly we need reform.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We have -- we have broad agreement in Congress on about 80 percent of what we\\'re trying to achieve.\\xa0 We have an agreement from drug companies to make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors -- $80 billion that can cut the doughnut hole that seniors have to deal with on prescription drug plans in half.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 The AARP supports this policy, and agrees with us that reform must happen this year. But look, because we\\'re getting close, the fight is getting fierce.\\xa0 And the history is clear:\\xa0 Every time we\\'re in sight of reform, the special interests start fighting back with everything they\\'ve got.\\xa0 They use their influence.\\xa0 They run their ads.\\xa0 And let\\'s face it, they get people scared.\\xa0 And understandably -- I understand why people are nervous.\\xa0 Health care is a big deal.\\xa0 In fact, whenever America has set about solving our toughest problems, there have always been those who\\'ve sought to preserve the status quo by scaring the American people. That\\'s what happened when FDR tried to pass Social Security -- they said that was socialist.\\xa0 They did -- verbatim.\\xa0 That\\'s what they said.\\xa0 They said that everybody was going to have to wear dog tags and that this was a plot for the government to keep track of everybody.\\xa0 When JFK and then Lyndon Johnson tried to pass Medicare, they said this was a government takeover of health care; they were going to get between you and your doctor -- the same argument that\\'s being made today. These struggles have always boiled down to a contest between hope and fear.\\xa0 It was true when Social Security was born.\\xa0 It was true when Medicare was created.\\xa0 It\\'s true in today\\'s debate.\\xa0 (Applause.) But whether you have health insurance or you don\\'t have health insurance, we all know we can\\'t continue down this path.\\xa0 Costs are rising far faster than wages.\\xa0 Cuts -- the system works a lot better for insurance companies than it does for America\\'s families.\\xa0 To maintain what\\'s best about our health care system, for you to keep what you\\'ve got if you\\'re happy with it, is going to require change. We\\'ve got to keep what\\'s good about the system, especially the relationship between doctors, nurses, and their patients, while fixing what\\'s broken -- because for all the scare tactics out there, what\\'s truly scary is if we don\\'t do anything.\\xa0 We will continue to see 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every day.\\xa0 Premiums will continue to skyrocket, going up three times faster than your wages.\\xa0 The deficit will continue to grow because most of it is Medicare and Medicaid.\\xa0 Medicare will go into the red in less than a decade.\\xa0 And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against people just because they\\'re sick. So if you want a different future -- a brighter future -- I need your help.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I need you to stand for hope.\\xa0 I need you to knock on doors.\\xa0 I need you to spread the word, because we are going to get this done this year.\\xa0 Thank you, Grand Junction.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 (Applause.) Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 All right.\\xa0 Now, I\\'ve got time for a bunch of questions.\\xa0 We\\'ve got a bunch of people in the audience with microphones.\\xa0 Hold up your microphones, guys.\\xa0 All right.\\xa0 Now, the way we\\'re going to do this is, I\\'m just going to go around the room.\\xa0 Raise your hand.\\xa0 To be fair I\\'m going to make sure it\\'s girl, boy, girl, boy.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 If you can introduce yourself and ask your question or make your comment, if you can keep your question or comment relatively brief, I will try to keep my answers relatively brief, and that way we can make sure that we get through more questions during the course of this event.\\xa0 All right?\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Let\\'s see hands.\\xa0 And I\\'ll start with this young lady right here in the pink blouse.\\xa0 Oops, hold on, the mic doesn\\'t -- can you check that mic?\\xa0 Is it working?\\xa0 Does it work? Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\xa0 My name is Polly.\\xa0 I work at Rocky Mountain Orthopedics here in Grand Junction.\\xa0 On behalf of our CEO, I would like to extend an invitation for you to visit our successful practice to see how we provide excellent health care at a lower average cost to our patients. My question is, the original health care House bill included funding for federally qualified health centers whose future budget would be based on expenses plus inflation.\\xa0 If private physicians, hospitals, and other providers are going to be given incentives to reduce waste and cost, what will be done to ensure the government programs will do the same? THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it\\'s an excellent question.\\xa0 Part of what\\'s so important about reform is that right now the way Medicare and Medicaid operates, if it\\'s starting to go over budget, we basically have two choices.\\xa0 Either we raise taxes and just keep on paying more and more, and health care inflation is going up at least twice as fast as inflation on everything else, or what we do is we just tell the providers, we\\'re going to give you less money -- period.\\xa0 We\\'ll reimburse you 80 cents or 90 cents for every dollar of services that you provide.\\xa0 And then what happens is that the providers, they end up just charging people with private insurance to make up for the difference.\\xa0 So that drives everybody\\'s costs up. Now what\\'s been done here in Grand Junction, in other outstanding health programs like Mayo, is they started to change the delivery system so that you\\'re actually getting more bang for your health care dollar. Let me give you an example.\\xa0 Right now if you go to your doctor and you get a test, a lot of times that test won\\'t be forwarded to the next doctor or specialist that you have to see.\\xa0 You have to take another test.\\xa0 You might have to take three or four or five tests by the time your treatment is all completed.\\xa0 That\\'s a waste of money.\\xa0 And if we can incentivize the provider to say, do one test and then e-mail the results to everybody who might be providing treatment, or the patient might be referred to, that right there saves a lot of money. So what we want to do is to do this in Medicare and Medicaid, which will incentivize a lot of health systems around the country to start using some of the smart practices that you\\'re using.\\xa0 Frankly, Medicare and Medicaid is -- they provide a lot of care for a lot of patients, particularly seniors, and so if they hear from Medicare, can you start doing things smarter, they have an incentive to do it, and once they put a smarter system in place, the benefits spill over to the private insurance market, as well.\\xa0 So we want to do it through Medicare and Medicaid, but we also want to see in the private insurance market that health providers start thinking smarter and providing better care, which often turns out to be lower-cost care. Now, it\\'s not going to happen overnight, because a lot of these systems have been put in place for a long time.\\xa0 And if you\\'re in Grand Junction or Mayo Clinic or Geisinger or other of these really good health care systems, what they\\'ve done is each year they are continually comparing notes, they\\'ve got a peer review process where doctors are exchanging ideas, and they\\'re continually making the system better and better, smarter and smarter, and over time what we can do is bend the cost curve so that instead of having inflation go up a lot faster on health care than everything else, it matches everything else. And if we could do that, if we could just get health care inflation to match the inflation on food and other items, all of our deficit -- long-term deficit problems would be solved.\\xa0 Just that alone.\\xa0 If we could just reduce the amount of health care inflation, our long-term debt and deficit problems would be solved. So this is the most important thing we can do for deficit reduction.\\xa0 And I want everybody to remember that, because in this debate you\\'ve heard a lot of people saying, \"We can\\'t afford to do this because our deficit and debt are too high.\"\\xa0 The biggest driver of our deficit and debt is health care.\\xa0 And if we don\\'t change delivery systems and adapt some of the innovations that are being used where you work and in really good health care systems around the country, then we\\'re going to be in red ink forever. Okay.\\xa0 Thank you so much for the question.\\xa0 (Applause.) All right.\\xa0 Gentleman in the red shirt back there.\\xa0 Wait for the mic so everybody can hear you. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, for taking my question, for one.\\xa0 I\\'ve got a bunch, but -- my name is Randy Piper (phonetic) and I have been in the health insurance business for over 25 years.\\xa0 I\\'m also a big Steelers fan, as well. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I like that in you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Are you allowed to confess that though here, where -- (laughter.) Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I can take it.\\xa0 (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, all right.\\xa0 Go ahead. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You have asked many times why insurance companies are so afraid of competing with a public plan option of coverage.\\xa0 And I understand insurance companies need to get spanked every now and again for sure, but if the public plan option reimburses on average 55 cents by contract of every dollar of care to the provider, and the private insurance plans by contract reimburse an average of 85 cents per dollar of care, how can it be considered fair competition?\\xa0 And thank you for being here today.\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think it\\'s a good question.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 For those of you who have not been following the debate as closely, let me just describe what this issue of the public plan is all about.\\xa0 And to do so, I\\'ve got to describe how we\\'re looking to provide health insurance for people who currently don\\'t have it.\\xa0 I spent most of my time talking about what we would do for folks who have health insurance, but we\\'ve still got 46 million uninsured and I think it is the right thing to provide them with some help.\\xa0 Most of them work.\\xa0 Most of them are responsible.\\xa0 But their employer -- maybe they work for a small business -- their employer just can\\'t afford it because they don\\'t have the bargaining power to get low enough rates to cover all their employees.\\xa0 That\\'s a big category of the uninsured. So what we\\'ve said is, let\\'s set up what\\'s called a health insurance exchange.\\xa0 It\\'s essentially a marketplace where you could go online and you\\'d have a menu of options, most of them private insurers -- Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield -- insurance companies that wanted to participate, and they would list a range of plans just like when Mike and Mark want to get health insurance as members of the Senate, they go on to this exchange for federal health care -- for federal employees, and they select which plan works best for their families. So we want everybody to be able to access that and choose which plan works best for them.\\xa0 And if they can\\'t afford it, even though we\\'d have a lot of bargaining power, we\\'d be able to get the same kinds of rates that really big companies are able to get or the federal system is able to get, some people will still not be able to afford it, and then we would provide some subsidies.\\xa0 And there would be certain rules governing any insurance company that\\'s participating:\\xa0 You couldn\\'t exclude for preexisting conditions; you couldn\\'t have a lifetime cap; you\\'d have to limit out-of-pocket expenses.\\xa0 So all the insurance rules that I talked about, that would be part of the deal if you as an insurer wanted to sell insurance through this exchange. So far, so good.\\xa0 The argument around public option is, should one of the choices -- not the only choice -- but one of the choices on that exchange be a public option?\\xa0 And the idea here would be that a government-run non-for-profit would have its own option that people could sign up for -- they wouldn\\'t have to, but they could sign up for it -- and if it could keep its costs lower and provide a good-quality service and good benefits, then that would help keep the insurance companies honest -- (applause) -- because the idea being -- the idea being that as a non-for-profit, potentially with lower administrative costs, they could do a good job. Now, the insurance companies have come back and said, well, that\\'s not fair, because nobody can compete against the government.\\xa0 They have a legitimate point if, if what\\'s being done is the government is either subsidizing that government plan -- essentially taking taxpayer money and saying, here, we\\'ll just keep on spending money regardless of whether you run a good operation or not, then it\\'s hard for insurance companies to compete against that.\\xa0 And by the way, it would be wildly expensive for taxpayers. So I\\'ve already said a public option can only work if they have to collect premiums just like a private insurer and compete on a level playing field.\\xa0 That\\'s point number one. The second argument that\\'s been made is the one that you just made, which is, if public option is reimbursing at Medicaid rates that are substantially lower than what private insurers have to negotiate for, then eventually, over time, private insurers might be run out of business.\\xa0 So that\\'s the second argument. Now, what\\'s happened in the House bill, that as it\\'s been modified, is they\\'ve actually said we\\'re going to negotiate rates, they won\\'t be Medicaid rates.\\xa0 So that actually solves the problem that you\\'re addressing, because now this would be a negotiated process and prices would not be set just to Medicaid.\\xa0 All right? Now, there\\'s a third argument against the public option, and this is the one, really, that you\\'ve been hearing mostly about, and that is just this idea that we shouldn\\'t have government involved at all, that government is part of the problem, not part of the solution, to quote Ronald Reagan.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We\\'ve got some supporters of that view.\\xa0 And I guess the only -- look, I think you can have a legitimate position just saying you don\\'t want to see more government involvement.\\xa0 I understand the argument.\\xa0 The only thing I would point out is, is that Medicare is a government program that works really well for our seniors and has protected people -- (applause) -- hold on one second, let\\'s not start yelling. It\\'s true that it\\'s expensive, but the truth is that actually the cost of Medicare inflation has actually gone up at a slower rate than private insurance.\\xa0 So it\\'s not because it\\'s mismanaged; it\\'s because of what was referred to in the first question -- the whole health care system is out of whack and way too expensive.\\xa0 It\\'s not government, per se.\\xa0 It has to do with the fact that the health care system itself, the delivery systems, are not working the way they should. So if you just believe the government shouldn\\'t be involved in anything, or shouldn\\'t be involved in health care, period, then you\\'re right that you can\\'t support the kind of reform that we\\'re proposing.\\xa0 The only thing I want to make sure of, though, is you\\'ve got to -- you make an honest argument, because nobody is talking about government takeover of health care.\\xa0 There\\'s a difference between what we\\'re proposing, which has some government involvement, versus this idea that somehow government is going to take over everything and get between your and doctor.\\xa0 That\\'s not what we\\'re proposing. So we can have an honest disagreement, but I just want to be clear on what the debate is about.\\xa0 It\\'s about this narrow issue of the public plan.\\xa0 It\\'s not about somehow eliminating private insurance.\\xa0 Everybody who has currently private insurance that works for them will be able to keep private insurance under the proposals that have been made in Congress.\\xa0 All right?\\xa0 (Applause.) Okay, it\\'s a woman\\'s turn.\\xa0 It\\'s a young lady\\'s turn.\\xa0 Let me -- right there with the vest.\\xa0 Yes, that\\'s you.\\xa0 (Laughter.) Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hello, Mr. President, and thanks for being here. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My name is Jamie and I am a nursing student at Mesa State.\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Outstanding. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Being as I am a potential health care provider in the health care system, there are a few things in the plan that I read about that I wanted to understand more -- THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 -- as far as providers being required to report -- what was the words -- preventable medical errors in the health care system.\\xa0 Now, as far as health care systems are concerned, we are required to report every error we see.\\xa0 So I kind of want a clarification of how much you\\'re expecting from providers in this system. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, different states have different rules.\\xa0 So we got kind of a patchwork.\\xa0 I don\\'t -- I confess I don\\'t know exactly what the rules are here in Colorado.\\xa0 But about 100,000 people die every year from preventable diseases and illnesses in hospitals.\\xa0 Some of the ways that we could solve this are so simple.\\xa0 There\\'s actually a doctor who\\'s put together a protocol -- washing your hands, a lot of just basic stuff that costs no money -- that has been shown repeatedly to cut these preventable illnesses and deaths down drastically -- by a magnitude of 50 percent, 75 percent reductions in preventable deaths just by applying these things that don\\'t cost any money. So the question then becomes, how do we get more hospitals, more doctors, more health systems, to adopt these systems.\\xa0 And the best way to do it is to make sure that not only are they reporting these preventable errors, but that they\\'re also available to consumers -- the American people -- so that if they\\'ve got too many of them, after a while they start getting embarrassed.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 I mean, if you found out that there are two hospitals here in this city and one hospital has half the preventable deaths of the other hospital, you\\'d want to know that, wouldn\\'t you? The problem is right now oftentimes it\\'s very hard for consumers to get that information directly.\\xa0 So the idea is simply to make sure that that information is packaged in a way where you can comparison shop, and your employer -- if you\\'re getting health insurance from your employer -- could comparison shop.\\xa0 So we\\'re putting some competitive pressure to improve quality across the system.\\xa0 That\\'s what we\\'re talking about.\\xa0 (Applause.) By the way, thank you for being a nurse, because we need more nurses.\\xa0 That\\'s important.\\xa0 (Applause.) All right, gentleman right here in the t-shirt.\\xa0 Hold on one second, we got a mic coming. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you for coming to Colorado.\\xa0 It\\'s a great place. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It\\'s a great place.\\xa0 (Applause.) Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You touched on this.\\xa0 I would like you to expand a little more.\\xa0 This problem with misinformation in our country, it seems to me that it\\'s not only just hurting health care reform, health insurance reform, it\\'s dividing our country.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Is it not maybe time -- I think we all know where it\\'s coming from.\\xa0 Is it not time that something can be done -- okay, I got to watch what I\\'m saying, but -- THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, look, let me -- let me just -- let me address this.\\xa0 You know, health care is really hard.\\xa0 I mean, this is not easy.\\xa0 I\\'m a reasonably dedicated student to this issue.\\xa0 I\\'ve got a lot of really smart people around me who have been working on this for months now.\\xa0 We\\'ve got really fine public servants like Senators Bennet and Udall who are working on this and thinking about it a lot. And the truth is -- I want to be completely honest here -- there is no perfect, painless silver bullet out there that solves every problem, gives everybody perfect health care for free.\\xa0 There isn\\'t.\\xa0 I wish there was.\\xa0 I wish I could just say, you know what, we\\'re going to change the system, everybody will get as much care as they want any time they want, everybody will have it, and it won\\'t cost anything.\\xa0 And doctors will be happy and nurses will be happy, hospitals will be happy, insurance companies will still make a lot of profits, drug companies will be able to charge as much as they want.\\xa0 I can\\'t do it.\\xa0 Nobody can. What I can do is try to sort through what are all the options available, be realistic about where we\\'re going on health care, say to myself, if we keep on doing what we\\'re doing, we are in a world of hurt.\\xa0 We can\\'t afford what we\\'re doing right now.\\xa0 More people are going to lose health insurance.\\xa0 More employers are going to drop coverage or push more coverage onto their employees with higher premiums and higher deductibles.\\xa0 Medicare and Medicaid will go broke.\\xa0 State budgets and federal budgets will be unsustainable. And then we\\'re going to have to make some really bad decisions where we had no good options -- even worse options than we have right now.\\xa0 And what\\'s going to end up happening is -- mark my words -- if we do nothing, at some point Medicare in about eight to nine years goes into the red.\\xa0 Somebody mentioned it\\'s going broke -- yes, it is going broke. So here\\'s what\\'s going to happen if we don\\'t change the delivery systems and change some of the incentives -- we\\'ll have a choice.\\xa0 We\\'ll either have to cut Medicare, in which case seniors then will bear the brunt of it, or we\\'ll have to raise taxes, which nobody likes.\\xa0 And we still will be paying about $5,000 to $6,000 more than any other advanced country in the world and not get better health care for it.\\xa0 Now that doesn\\'t make sense. So in terms of misinformation, there is -- because there\\'s no perfect solution, we can have legitimate debates about the public option that we just had.\\xa0 That was a good, serious debate, and you can make a plausible argument as to why we shouldn\\'t have a public option.\\xa0 Now, I believe that we should on balance.\\xa0 It\\'s not perfect.\\xa0 It\\'s not going to solve every problem, but I think it actually would keep the insurance companies more honest.\\xa0 You can have a honest disagreement with me on that. What you can\\'t do -- or you can, but you shouldn\\'t do -- is start saying things like, we want to set up death panels to pull the plug on grandma.\\xa0 I mean, come on.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I mean, I just -- first of all, when you make a comment like that -- I just lost my grandmother last year.\\xa0 I know what it\\'s like to watch somebody you love, who\\'s aging, deteriorate, and have to struggle with that.\\xa0 So the notion that somehow I ran for public office, or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma?\\xa0 I mean, when you start making arguments like that, that\\'s simply dishonest, especially when I hear the arguments coming from members of Congress in the other party who, turns out, sponsored similar provisions. Here\\'s what this was about.\\xa0 Here was the genesis of this little piece of information.\\xa0 We had a provision in the House bill that would give the option -- the option -- of somebody getting counseling on end-of-life care or hospice care, and have it reimbursed by Medicare; the option -- voluntary -- so you\\'d have more information about how to deal with these situations. Turns out the biggest proponent of this was a Republican congressman who is now a senator and a colleague of Mr. Udall and Mr. Bennet.\\xa0 Turns out in Medicare Part D, which was passed by a Republican Congress, they had the exact same provision. So when I have people who just a couple of years ago thought this was a good idea now getting on television suggesting that it\\'s a plot against grandma or to sneak euthanasia into our health care system, that feels dishonest to me.\\xa0 And we\\'ve got enough stuff to deal with without having these kinds of arguments.\\xa0 (Applause.) All right, so it\\'s -- all right, it\\'s a woman\\'s turn here.\\xa0 Yes, I sort of neglected this area right here.\\xa0 Young lady right there, blond hair, black blouse -- white dress.\\xa0 Yes, right there.\\xa0 Go ahead. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi, my name is Julie, and I\\'m a small business owner from Colorado Springs.\\xa0 I am also a Republican that voted for you. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You\\'re welcome.\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What\\'s your business? Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We make software. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excellent.\\xa0 We need that. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I hope so.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 So I grew up in a blue-collar family, and my husband and I work very hard at our small business.\\xa0 We\\'ve always treated our employees like family, given them great benefits, any time off they need with their family.\\xa0 I volunteer in my professional community.\\xa0 I volunteer at my children\\'s schools.\\xa0 And that\\'s still not enough, because us small business owners that are on that cusp between middle class and the rich are going to bear the brunt of a lot of what this is going to cost.\\xa0 Why is what I do now not enough?\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me -- I think it\\'s a good question.\\xa0 Let me talk about both cost and what this would mean for small businesses, because both issues would affect you. First of all, remember what I said, I can\\'t come up with a perfect solution that is completely free.\\xa0 It is absolutely true that in order for us to provide help to those who have no insurance at all, that\\'s going to cost some money.\\xa0 It\\'s going to cost some money.\\xa0 We can\\'t do it for free.\\xa0 They\\'ve got no health insurance right now; we\\'re going to help them.\\xa0 It\\'s 46 million people.\\xa0 That\\'s going to cost some money. Now, what I\\'ve proposed is going to cost roughly $900 billion -- $800 billion to $900 billion.\\xa0 That\\'s a lot of money.\\xa0 Keep in mind it\\'s over 10 years.\\xa0 So when you hear some of these figures thrown out there, this is not per year, this is over 10 years.\\xa0 So let\\'s assume it\\'s about $80 billion a year.\\xa0 It turns out that about two-thirds of that could be paid for by eliminating waste in the existing system. So I\\'ll give you -- let me give you one particular example.\\xa0 We right now provide $177 billion over 10 years -- or about $17 billion, $18 billion a year -- to insurance companies in the forms of subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage where they basically run the Medicare program that everybody else has, except they get an extra bunch of money that they make a big profit off of.\\xa0 And there\\'s no proof, no evidence at all that seniors are better off using Medicare Advantage than regular Medicare.\\xa0 If we could save that $18 billion a year, that is money that we can use to help people who right now need some help. So about two-thirds of what we\\'re talking about is paid for through the existing health care system, money that\\'s already being paid by taxpayers -- does not require additional taxes.\\xa0 But that still leaves one-third. Now, in order to pay for that, there have been a lot of proposals out there.\\xa0 One of them that I proposed, I still think is the best idea.\\xa0 You may disagree, because I don\\'t know what your income bracket is.\\xa0 My proposal was that for people making more than $250,000 a year -- people like myself -- that we should, instead of getting the full itemized deduction of what our highest tax bracket is, we should just cap out our itemized deduction at 28 percent, which is what the average American gets.\\xa0 So -- because my attitude is, I shouldn\\'t get a bigger tax break if I write a check to my local church than if the janitor down the street writes a check to their local church.\\xa0 We should get the same tax break.\\xa0 If we were willing to do that, just that alone would pay for what we\\'re talking about.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now, some members of Congress disagree with that and they\\'ve got other proposals, and that\\'s going to be worked out in September. I do want to make the point, though, that I have not proposed any plan that would put the burden on middle-class families in order to deal with this.\\xa0 So when you hear people talking about I\\'m raising your taxes, the only tax policies I\\'ve implemented for middle-class families is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families. Now, let me talk about small businesses.\\xa0 I don\\'t know your particular situation, whether you\\'re providing health insurance right now to your employees.\\xa0 If you are, then you stand to benefit from this plan because every proposal, both in the House and the Senate, that\\'s been put forward, provides a huge number of subsidies to small business owners that are doing the right thing by their employees.\\xa0 (Applause.) So it is very likely -- you know, obviously we\\'d have to look at the calculation; I\\'d have to figure out how many employees you have, what kind of health insurance plan you had, et cetera -- but it is very likely that you would actually make money, gain from this plan, because you\\'re already providing health insurance to your employees and we would give you some help. The only category of folks who might not like this plan are employers who can afford to provide health insurance to their employees but aren\\'t doing so, because what we would then say to them, what we\\'d say to them is, look, we\\'re giving you affordable options; you are going to be able now to be part of a bigger pool.\\xa0 You can buy your health insurance through that exchange that I was explaining to that gentleman there.\\xa0 So you\\'ll be able to get premiums and prices that are comparable to what big companies, Xerox or IBM, are getting for their employees, and we\\'ll give you some help doing it. But if you refuse to provide any health insurance for your employees at all, then we are going to ask you to make a contribution to help make sure those employees have health insurance, because by the way, it turns out if you as an employer are not providing that health insurance, the rest of us are, because those folks are going on Medicaid, or they\\'re going to the hospitals for uncompensated care, and that\\'s not fair.\\xa0 (Applause.) So the bottom line is this:\\xa0 If you are a small business person who is providing health insurance for your employees, I am very sure that you would actually benefit from this.\\xa0 But the problem is -- again, this is where the information has not been going out in as clear a fashion as possible, which is why I\\'m glad you asked the question. All right?\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 (Applause.) All right, I\\'m going to call on this gentleman because he\\'s been waving -- and he\\'s shouted at me a couple of times, so I just want to -- I just want proof here that I\\'m happy to get a good debate going.  Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How are you doing, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I\\'m good.\\xa0 What\\'s your name? Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My name is Zack Lane (phonetic).\\xa0 I\\'m a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good to talk to you, Zack.\\xa0 What do you study? Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Political science and business marketing. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Fantastic.\\xa0 All right, what\\'s your question? Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My question is this.\\xa0 And also, I\\'d love to have a debate, just all out, anytime, Oxford-style, if you\\'d like.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 I understand -- I\\'m willing to do that.\\xa0 But my question is this.\\xa0 We all know the best way to reduce prices in this economy is to increase competition.\\xa0 How in the world can a private corporation providing insurance compete with an entity that does not have to worry about making a profit, does not have to pay local property taxes -- (applause) -- they do not have to -- they\\'re not subject to local regulations?\\xa0 How can a company compete with that?\\xa0 And I\\'m not looking for anything -- I don\\'t want generalities.\\xa0 I don\\'t want philosophical arguments.\\xa0 I\\'m just asking a question. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\'s a great question.\\xa0 Thank you for the question.\\xa0 (Applause.) Now, I just want to point out that I partially answered the question earlier by explaining that certainly they can\\'t compete if the taxpayer is standing behind the public option just shoveling more and more money at it, right?\\xa0 That\\'s certainly not fair.\\xa0 And so I\\'ve already said I would not be in favor of a public option of that sort because that would just mean more expenses out of our pockets and we wouldn\\'t be seeing much improvement in quality. It is true that there are certain costs associated with a private business that a government would not have to worry about; you mentioned a couple of them.\\xa0 It\\'s not just, by the way, property taxes; it\\'s also things like just the cost of capital.\\xa0 In terms of the cost of borrowing, a public option -- insurance companies have to have a lot of money on hand and it\\'s conceivable that a private entity that\\'s having to pay a certain interest rate for their money would be really undermined if the government is able to get money much cheaper implicitly because Uncle Sam backs this operation. So that\\'s why I say, this is actually a legitimate debate.\\xa0 I think that we can craft a system in which you\\'ve got a public option that has to operate independently, not subsidized by taxpayers -- it would be nonprofit, but we\\'ve already got nonprofits out there like BlueCross BlueShield -- that they would have to go on the market and get a market price for capital, so they wouldn\\'t be able to just have the Federal Reserve write them a check.\\xa0 I think there are ways that we can address those competitive issues.\\xa0 And you\\'re absolutely right, if they\\'re not entirely addressed, then that raises a set of legitimate problems. But the only point I wanted to make was the notion that somehow just by having a public option you have the entire private marketplace destroyed is just not borne out by the facts.\\xa0 And in fact, right now you\\'ve got a lot of private companies who do very well competing against the government.\\xa0 UPS and FedEx are doing a lot better than the post office.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 No, they are.\\xa0 And so -- but the larger point I want to make -- and it\\'s good to see a young person who\\'s very engaged and confident challenging the President to a Oxford-style debate, I think this is good.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 You know, the -- this is good.\\xa0 You know, I like that.\\xa0 You got to have a little chutzpah, you know. This is a legitimate debate to have.\\xa0 All I\\'m saying is, though, that the public option, whether we have it or we don\\'t have it, is not the entirety of health care reform.\\xa0 This is just one sliver of it, one aspect of it.\\xa0 And by the way, it\\'s both the right and the left that have become so fixated on this that they forget everything else, like the fact that we can help Nathan make sure that he doesn\\'t suddenly find himself -- (applause) -- completely broke in trying to treat his son. So we are working on a series of proposals to address the questions that you\\'re raising.\\xa0 I believe that we can work them out.\\xa0 But those are specific questions as opposed to broad, philosophical questions about whether government ever has a role to play or not. Keep in mind, finally -- and this is the last point that I\\'ll make -- that you have a bunch of countries that have systems in which government is involved but you still have a thriving private insurance market -- The Netherlands being a good example.\\xa0 Everybody is covered.\\xa0 Everybody has care.\\xa0 The government has regulations in there.\\xa0 But it does not somehow take over the entire private insurance market.\\xa0 So I just want people to understand nobody is talking about a government takeover of health care.\\xa0 I want to repeat that one last time. All right.\\xa0 I\\'ve got -- I\\'ve got one last -- I\\'ve got time for one last question.\\xa0 I\\'m going to call on this young lady right here.\\xa0 Oops, she just lost her question.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Who\\'s got a microphone?\\xa0 Right here, right here. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I cannot believe that we have the President of the United States of America in Grand Junction, Colorado!\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good to be here. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We are so proud of you. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 (Applause.) Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My name is Marie Elena, and I live in the Western Slope in Montrose, Colorado.\\xa0 And I am a naturalized citizen, and I am proud to be an American in this beautiful land.\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As a child I had polio, and I had a series of surgeries, 52 of them, to correct my poor structure of bones -- between here, Denver, Montrose, and the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona.\\xa0 I have been blessed with a good insurance, generally excellent doctors and care.\\xa0 However, my major concern in cost, even with good -- even with a good insurance, the cost has been high, practically when I have been gone out of the network.\\xa0 Why should our doctor treatment choice be limited by a geographic area or the state?\\xa0 What kind of competition is this, Mr. President?\\xa0 (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, all right. Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This raises an important question, because it goes to the overall debate that\\'s taking place out there right now.\\xa0 When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it.\\xa0 Well, that\\'s what\\'s going on right now.\\xa0 It\\'s just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies. Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world anytime, regardless of expense.\\xa0 That would be a hard system to set up.\\xa0 So if you live in Maine, you know, we\\'re going to fly you into California, put you up.\\xa0 I mean, you can see -- and I\\'m not trying to make light of it -- you can just see the difficulty. So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what\\'s going on, et cetera.\\xa0 That\\'s being done currently in the private marketplace. All we\\'re trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren\\'t discriminating against people because they\\'re already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending. So let\\'s make sure, for example, that if you go to a hospital, you get one of those operations that you discussed, and it turns out that two weeks later you\\'ve got to be readmitted because they didn\\'t do it right the first time, that the hospital has to pay some penalty for that, or at least they\\'re not being reimbursed as much as a hospital who gets it right the first time.\\xa0 That\\'s an example of changing incentives that can save us money. The more that we make those kinds of changes that improve quality, reduce cost, the more likely it is that more Americans have more options and that they are not being jerked around.\\xa0 It doesn\\'t mean that everything is going to be perfect, but it does mean that consumers will have more choices, better options, more security, more protection. That\\'s all we\\'re trying to accomplish here and we\\'re trying to do it in a way that over time reduces costs overall for families, whether you\\'re getting Medicare or you\\'re getting Medicaid or you\\'ve got private insurance through your employer or you\\'re a small business owner.\\xa0 That\\'s what we\\'re trying to accomplish. And I am confident that we can accomplish it -- but we\\'re going to have to work hard to do it, and we\\'re going to have to overcome some of the wrong information, and we\\'re going to have to have an honest debate.\\xa0 Nothing is going to be perfect.\\xa0 We\\'re going to have to make sure -- this is something, by the way, that people need to understand:\\xa0 Even if everything goes perfectly and we pass legislation, let\\'s say, in October, we\\'re still going to have another three months of debate about this, then we\\'re still going to have several years of implementation.\\xa0 It\\'s not going to happen overnight.\\xa0 We\\'re going to have to set up these reforms and these processes, and we\\'re going to have to give insurance companies the chance to adjust, because, for example, if we don\\'t have everybody covered, we can\\'t construct a system that prevents insurance companies from discriminating against preexisting conditions.\\xa0 I hope everybody understands that. We can\\'t tell insurance to take everybody if, on the other hand, you\\'ve got a whole bunch of people who are healthy and young who choose not to get insurance at all, because what ends up happening is then insurance companies are just going to take the people when they get sick.\\xa0 Somebody won\\'t buy insurance until they find out that they\\'re sick.\\xa0 Then they go into the insurance office and they say, give me insurance so I can go pay my bill.\\xa0 Insurance companies would lose money pretty quick that way. So if we\\'re going to eliminate the preexisting conditions problem, we\\'ve got to also -- have the coverage problem, and that\\'s why this is going to have to be phased in over a number of years. Last point I want to make, and this has to do with the budget issues, because we\\'ve got a huge deficit right now and a huge debt, and I think that that\\'s coloring how people view the debate.\\xa0 I hear a lot of people say, how can we afford this right now?\\xa0 We\\'ve got to reduce our deficit. First, I want everybody to understand the source of our deficit, because if you don\\'t understand that, then my argument won\\'t make sense.\\xa0 When I walked into the White House, I had gift-wrapped, waiting for me at the door a $1.3 trillion deficit -- $1.3 trillion.\\xa0 Now, I say that -- (applause) -- I just want to -- I just want to -- I just want to -- I say that -- this was not -- and this is not, by the way, entirely the previous administration\\'s fault.\\xa0 The financial crisis was so bad that revenues plummeted and all this money was spent in making sure that the banking system did not completely collapse.\\xa0 So all the actions that have been taken -- the bank bailout, the auto bailout, all that stuff -- that did spike the deficit. But the problem actually is not that -- you know, the extraordinary steps that we\\'ve taken over these last one or two years.\\xa0 The real problem is much longer.\\xa0 Even if we had had no fiscal crisis whatsoever, we have a structural deficit.\\xa0 We\\'re spending more money than we are taking in.\\xa0 We\\'ve been doing it for the last eight years.\\xa0 When we passed the prescription drug benefit for Medicare, by a Republican Congress, they didn\\'t pay for it.\\xa0 They didn\\'t want to raise taxes, but they wanted to get the benefit.\\xa0 That just was red ink.\\xa0 That just went into our structural deficit. When we fought the Iraq war, we made that decision.\\xa0 We didn\\'t pay for it.\\xa0 When we cut taxes on some of the wealthiest Americans, we did not compensate by making cuts in programs that were comparable.\\xa0 So what that has all added up to is, we\\'ve got a structural deficit that over the course of the next 10 years is about $9 trillion. Now, I say that because I just want everybody to understand, if we\\'re going to tackle that problem, the only way we can do it in an intelligent way is if we get control of Medicare and Medicaid spending in some realistic way.\\xa0 If we don\\'t do that -- if we don\\'t do that, we can\\'t simply cut our way out of the problem or tax our way out of the problem. I ask sometimes, when I\\'m in audiences, what people think the amount of federal budget is devoted to foreign aid.\\xa0 And people will say, 25 percent; if we could just cut that out, we could eliminate the deficit.\\xa0 Foreign aid is 1 percent of our budget -- 1 percent.\\xa0 People think, well, it\\'s all these pork projects and earmarks that everybody is getting.\\xa0 One percent.\\xa0 Almost all of our spending is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the national debt, defense spending -- things that are very hard to cut. Only about -- only about 30 percent of the overall budget, somewhere between 25 and 30 percent is non-defense discretionary spending.\\xa0 That\\'s everything for national parks, for education, you name it.\\xa0 Every single program that you think of that you think of as a government program, that is only about 25 percent of the budget.\\xa0 The rest of it is all Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\\xa0 And what\\'s really going up fastest is Medicare and Medicaid. So I just want everybody to understand, if you are a fiscal hawk, if you are -- if you are a deficit hawk and you are tired of this crazy spending in Washington and you want to finally make sure that we are looking out for the next generation, then you, more than anybody, should want to reform the health care system -- because if we don\\'t do it, we can\\'t solve that problem.\\xa0 (Applause.) Thank you, Grand Junction.\\xa0 Love you.\\xa0 (Applause.) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   END\\xa0   5:10 P.M.

EDT\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hello, Indiana!\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 It's good to see you guys.\\xa0 It's good to see you.\\xa0 Hello, hello, hello!\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 It is good to be here.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And it's a pleasure to be with your outstanding representatives in Congress -- Andre Carson, Joe Donnelly, Brad Ellsworth, Baron Hill -- give it up for these outstanding members of Congress.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We're here to make sure they can stay right where they belong:\\xa0 in the United States Congress, representing your hopes, representing your dreams, carrying your voices to Washington, DC. (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt's good to be back in Indiana.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We spent a little time in Indiana.\\xa0 It reminds me of why I like getting out of Washington so much.\\xa0 People are friendly.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 It brings back a lot of memories from all those days out here on the campaign trail.\\xa0 So I want to start out tonight by saying thank you -- thank you to all of you here in Indiana.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I know that I'm here tonight because of you, and folks like you across this country who made the phone calls, and knocked on the doors, and registered voters, and dug deep and gave whatever you could, because you were hungry for new ideas and new leadership and a new kind of politics.\\xa0 And that's what we are trying to deliver right now in Washington.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou believed that after an era of selfishness and greed, we could reclaim a sense of responsibility from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington.\\xa0 You believed that instead of huge inequalities and bubbles that bust, we could restore a sense of fairness and stability to our economy, and build a new foundation for lasting growth and prosperity.\\xa0 You believed that at a time of war and turmoil, we could stand strong against our enemies, stand strong for our ideals, and show a new face of American leadership around the world.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 That's the change you believed in; that's the trust you placed in me; that's something that I will never forget.\\nBut we know that winning that election was just the beginning of our work.\\xa0 It wasn’t the end, it was just the start -- it was the end of the beginning.\\xa0 That victory alone was not the change that we sought -- it was just the opportunity to make the change.\\xa0 And I don't know about you, but I think it's fair to say that over these past four months, we have seized this opportunity.\\nTo jumpstart job creation and get our economy moving again, we passed the most ambitious economic recovery package in our nation's history.\\xa0 We gave tax cuts to 95 percent of working Americans and put back people to work modernizing our health care system; and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and transit systems; and investing in renewable energy that could help boost our economy and preserve our planet.\\xa0\\nWe launched plans to stabilize our housing market and unfreeze our credit markets, and to ensure the survival of our auto industry in this new century.\\xa0 We passed a budget that will cut our deficit in half while making investments to spur long-term growth.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe lifted the ban on federal funding for stem cell research. We expanded the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 11 million children in need.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We passed a national service bill to create hundreds of thousands of opportunities to serve.\\xa0 We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- the first bill I signed into law, because we believe in equal pay for equal work.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\nSo we're making progress.\\xa0 And I'm pleased with how far we've come -- but I'm not satisfied.\\xa0 I'm confident in the future, but I am not content.\\xa0 Not when there's still workers who are out of a job, and families who can't pay the bills.\\xa0 Not when too many Americans can't afford health care, and so many of our kids are being left behind.\\xa0 Not when our nation has failed to lead the world in developing 21st century energy.\\xa0 We've come a long way, we can see some light on the horizon, but we've got a much longer journey ahead.\\nThat's why all of you are here tonight.\\xa0 That's why you're digging deep again, even when times are a little tight -- why I know you're going to make those calls and knock on those doors and get to the polls again next November -- (applause) -- because we've got to make sure these four leaders continue their devoted service to Indiana and to America.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd that's why I'm here tonight.\\xa0 That's why I'm here, because I can't bring the change I promised all by myself.\\xa0 I can't rebuild our economy, and reform our health care system and our education system, and preserve our environment, and keep our nation safe if I'm all alone in the Oval Office.\\xa0 That's not how our democracy works.\\xa0\\nI need partners in Congress -- people who are going to work hard every day to move this country forward.\\xa0 That's why I'm supporting these gentlemen.\\xa0 That's why I believe in Andre Carson and Joe Donnelly and Brad Ellsworth and Baron Hill.\\xa0 (Applause.) They serve their constituents and this nation with dedication and intelligence and compassion and pride.\\xa0 They're determined to make a difference for the people they represent.\\xa0\\nMore than ever before, we need their help -- America needs their help.\\xa0 We need their help to build schools that meet high standards, and close achievement gaps, and prepare our children for the 21st century challenges that they'll confront; where we reward teachers for performance and give them new pathways for advancement.\\xa0 And we need their help to reach the goal that I've set for higher education in this country:\\xa0 that by the year 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\\xa0 We used to have that distinction; we don't anymore.\\xa0 We are going to get it back with the help of these four gentlemen right here.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe need their help to pass a comprehensive energy plan and climate bill that will finally reduce our dependence on foreign oil, cap carbon pollution that threatens our health and our climate -- (applause) -- a plan that will create millions of new jobs producing wind turbines and solar panels and the alternative fuels that will power the future.\\xa0 Because we know that the nation that leads on energy, on clean energy in the 21st century, that's the nation that will lead economically -- and America can and must be that nation.\\xa0\\nI need these gentlemen's help to create a 21st century health care system that's cutting costs for families and businesses.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I've already met with representatives from the insurance and drug companies, from doctors and hospitals and labor unions.\\xa0 These groups, some of them used to be fierce critics of health care reform back in 1993.\\xa0 But today, they've pledged to do their part to reduce the annual health care spending growth rate by 1.5 percent.\\xa0 And coupled with comprehensive reform, that could save us up to $2 trillion -- $2,500 per family every year.\\xa0 And working with these congressmen, we're going to do everything we can to achieve comprehensive health care reform by the end of this year.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\nAre we going to get it done, gentlemen?\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 This is the year to get it done.\\xa0\\nAnd we need these gentlemen to help give working people in this country a fair shake again.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 To make sure our workers can be paid fairly and treated fairly for the work that they do.\\xa0 I've got to say a few words about where we're gathered tonight.\\xa0 It's a fine establishment.\\xa0 But there are workers here from Indianapolis hotels who are seeking to unionize -- (applause) -- including some right here at the Westin.\\xa0 And I want to recognize these workers and offer my support for their efforts.\\xa0 Where are they?\\xa0 Raise your hands, guys.\\xa0 Right here.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We appreciate you.\\xa0\\nIn these difficult times, our country will be stronger if management and workers come together to resolve disputes and work together to provide quality service.\\xa0 And workers should never be punished for demanding the right to collectively bargain -- (applause).\\xa0 That's not right; we won't stand for it.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\nAnd finally, we need these four leaders to help us restore fiscal discipline in Washington so we don't leave our children and grandchildren with a mountain of debt.\\xa0 These are some of the leaders in trying to get Washington to take those responsibilities seriously.\\xa0 Already, my administration has identified more than 100 government programs that we can reduce or eliminate, save $17 billion next year alone.\\xa0 We're going line by line through the budget, page by page, looking for even more cuts.\\xa0\\nI've personally asked the leadership in Congress to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule that we followed during the 1990s, a rule that will help start -- (applause) -- a rule that helped us start this new century with a $236 billion surplus.\\xa0 You remember that?\\xa0 The idea is very simple:\\xa0 You don't spend what you don't have.\\xa0 If you want to spend, you need to find someplace else to cut.\\xa0 That's the rule that families across this country follow every single day -- and there's no reason why their government shouldn't do the same.\\nSo, look, Indiana, we're living through some extraordinary times.\\xa0 We didn't ask for the challenges we face, but we're determined to answer the call to meet them; to cast aside the old arguments, overcome the stubborn divisions, to move forward as one people.\\nIt won't be easy and there's going to be setbacks.\\xa0 It's going to take time.\\xa0 This is going to be a hard year -- and next year is not going to be so easy either.\\xa0 But I promise you that we will get through this.\\xa0 I'll always tell you the truth about the challenges we face and the steps that we're taking, and I'll continue to measure my progress by the progress the American people are seeing in their own everyday lives.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd if you stand with me, if you stand with Andre Carson and Joe Donnelly and Brad Ellsworth and Baron Hill -- (applause) -- then I know we will look back on this moment, at the time that we came together to reclaim America's future, to write the next great chapter in the American story.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\nThank you, everybody.\\xa0 God bless you.\\xa0 God bless America.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\nEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n6:47 P.M.

PDT\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nancy Pelosi!\\xa0 Hello, San Francisco!\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Hey!\\xa0 How are you?\\xa0 Hello.\\xa0 It’s good to see all of you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Just a couple of quick special thank yous.\\xa0 I love all of you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 But there are a couple people I want to make sure to acknowledge.\\nFirst of all, thank you Tracy Chapman for performing tonight.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0 Love Tracy Chapman.\\xa0 Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi, who is running for the California 10 upcoming election –- everybody has got to go out there and work for John.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 There he is right –- stand up, John, so everybody can see you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0 Fantastic.\\nLet me tell you about Nancy Pelosi.\\xa0 Somebody in an introduction was saying everybody has a kind word to say about Nancy Pelosi, her generosity, her intelligence.\\xa0 All that's true.\\xa0 Let me talk to you –- Nancy Pelosi is tough.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 I want everybody to know that.\\xa0 I mean, every day –- every day –- she is subjected to constant criticism and griping.\\xa0 And then there’s the other party.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nBut with style and grace, but most importantly, with steely determination, she does not back down, she is there doing battle each and every day on behalf of not only her constituency here in California, but people all across America who are looking for a fair shake, who are looking for a decent job, who are looking for quality health care, who want a good education for their kids, who want a planet that they can pass on to their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.\\xa0 That's what Nancy Pelosi is all about.\\xa0 We could not have done any of the stuff that we’ve done this year without one of the best Speakers imaginable.\\xa0 So, please, everybody, I know sometimes you're not a prophet in your own land but I want everybody to understand how special Nancy Pelosi is and give her a big round of applause.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\nIt’s good to be back in California.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\\xa0 We love you!\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I love you, too.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I appreciate the warm welcome –- especially the weather.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 It just got cold in D.C., so I was happy flying in over the Bay and it’s sunny; it’s nice.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 This is a pretty place you guys live.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 But obviously what I appreciate even more is the opportunity that you’ve given me and my administration to serve on your behalf.\\xa0 And I’m here to tell you that we are keeping faith with your support.\\xa0 We are working every single day to fulfill your hopes.\\xa0 Every day we’re asking ourselves how can we realize the dreams that led so many people to join our cause when it seemed so improbable.\\n\\xa0\\nBut I’ve got to say, looking out at a room full of so many supporters, I am reminded of what President Lincoln once said to one of his own supporters who claimed that it was his efforts that made the difference in the election. The guy had come in, he met Lincoln, he said, it’s because of you –- “It’s because of me that you’re sitting here.”\\xa0 “So you think you made me President?” Lincoln said.\\xa0 “Yes,” the man replied, “under Providence, I think I did.”\\xa0 “Well,” said Lincoln, “it’s a pretty mess you’ve got me into.\\xa0 But I forgive you.”\\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\\xa0 That's how I feel about you.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 You're all forgiven.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\xa0\\nIt’s been about 10 months since the Obama family packed up and moved to Washington.\\xa0 And I want to report to you that Malia and Sasha are doing great.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Michelle has been extraordinary as First Lady.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We have Bo, which has lowered my seniority to fifth at the dinner table.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nBut I do think it’s important for all of us to remember, even though it’s been almost a year, what was happening in this country when we walked through that front door –- because, you know, people seem to have a sort of selective memory.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 People seem to forget, they seem to think that suddenly I was sworn in and there was this big financial crisis.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 So let’s just do a little walk down memory lane.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nWe were facing an economic crisis unlike any that we’ve seen in our times.\\xa0 We were losing 700,000 jobs a month.\\xa0 Our financial system was on the brink of collapse.\\xa0 Economists of every political stripe we’re saying we might be slipping into the next Great Depression.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd that’s why working with Nancy Pelosi and working with Harry Reid we passed boldly and swiftly a Recovery Act that’s made a difference in the lives of families and communities in every corner of the country.\\xa0 And California has been particularly hard hit.\\xa0 And I know families here are struggling more than folks in a lot of other parts of the country.\\xa0 And leaders are having to make tough choices about how to navigate through this economic storm.\\xa0 But I also know that if it hadn’t been for that Recovery Act here in California and all across America, if it weren’t for the Recovery Act we’d be in a much deeper hole.\\xa0 And that is a fact.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\xa0\\nWe put a tax cut in the pockets of small business owners and 95 percent of working Americans -– just as I promised on the campaign trail.\\xa0 That tax cut has benefited more than 12 million families here in California at a time when they were losing income, and in some cases losing jobs.\\xa0 Increased unemployment insurance for 12 million Americans to help them get through tough times.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 That's helped nearly 2 million Californians.\\xa0 We made COBRA 65 percent cheaper –- (applause) -- to make sure that when you are out there looking for a job you could still have your health insurance.\\xa0 We provided relief to states like California so they wouldn’t have to lay off teachers and firefighters and police officers.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Gave 30,000 loans to small businesses all across America -– including nearly 4,000 right here in California -– that have helped to create and save tens of thousands of private sector jobs.\\n\\xa0\\nBut the Recovery Act wasn’t just about tax cuts -– the most progressive, by the way, tax cuts in American history.\\xa0 It wasn’t emergency relief for middle class families and working families who’ve borne the brunt of the recession.\\xa0 It also was the largest investment in education in American history.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 It was also the largest investment in clean energy in American history.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 It was also the largest investment in the nation’s infrastructure since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System back in the 1950s –- (applause) –- putting people back to work all across the country, rebuilding roads and bridges and waterways.\\n\\xa0\\nThat’s not all we did in those first few months.\\xa0 Nancy –- Nancy mentioned a few other things.\\xa0 We decided maybe it makes sense to pay women the same as men for the same work.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0 And that's why we signed the Lilly Ledbetter –- the first bill I had the honor to sign into law.\\xa0 Lifted the ban on stem cell research –- (applause) -- began to restore science to its rightful place here in America.\\xa0 Extended health insurance to 11 million children across the country who had been left out, under the Children’s Health Insurance bill.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Passed legislation to protect consumers from unfair rate hikes and abusive fees charged by credit card companies.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Passed laws to protect our children from being targeted by big tobacco companies.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Made sure that housing fraud was prevented.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Placed a new national policy for the first time in our history aimed at both increasing fuel economy and reducing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\xa0\\nThat’s what we did here at home.\\xa0 Abroad, we began a new era of engagement.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Working with partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons –- (applause) -- and seek the long-term goal of a safer, more secure world free of nuclear weapons.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Working in concert with other nations on just about every continent to stem the global economic downturn and to confront climate change.\\xa0 We banned torture.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We’re closing Guantanamo.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We’re rebuilding our military.\\xa0 We’re reaffirming our alliances.\\xa0 We are drawing down responsibly and ending the war in Iraq.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 We made good progress in taking the fight to al Qaeda –- from Pakistan to Somalia to Indonesia.\\xa0 I went to Cairo on behalf of America to start a new dialogue with the Muslim world.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\xa0\\nSo just in case you're wondering what we’ve been doing over the last nine months –- (laughter) –- thought it might be useful to check in with you.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 You wouldn’t always know it watching cable.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\\xa0 Don’t watch it!\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\",\n",

EDT   PRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Hello, everybody.\\xa0 I just want to welcome Secretary General Rasmussen to the Oval Office.\\xa0 He and I had the opportunity to get to know each other at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, at which he was nominated and then selected as the new Secretary General of NATO.\\xa0 I can say that, given his experience as a head of state, that everybody had confidence in his decisive and effective leadership abilities.\\xa0 That confidence has proven justified.\\xa0 In the brief time that he has been in NATO, I think he\\'s already shown himself to be an active and effective Secretary General, interested in reforming and renewing the NATO Alliance, and always rooted in the understanding that this is the most successful military alliance in history and the cornerstone of transatlantic relationships. We had a very fruitful discussion while he was here.\\xa0 We talked about, obviously, the most important NATO mission right now, and that is Afghanistan.\\xa0 And we both agree that it is absolutely critical that we are successful in dismantling, disrupting, destroying the al Qaeda network, and that we are effectively working with the Afghan government to provide the security necessary for that country.\\xa0 This is not a American battle; this is a NATO mission, as well.\\xa0 And we are working actively and diligently to consult with NATO at every step of the way.\\xa0 And I\\'m very grateful for the leadership that Secretary General Rasmussen has shown in committing NATO to a full partnership in this process. We also discussed missile defense, and we both agreed that the configuration that we have proposed is one that ultimately will serve the interests of not only the United States, but also NATO Alliance members most effectively.\\xa0 It allows for a full collaboration with NATO members, and we are very optimistic that it will achieve our aims and deal with the very real threat of ballistic missiles. We also agree that it is important for us to reach out to Russia and explore ways in which the missile defense configurations that we envision could potentially lead to further collaboration with Russia on this front; and that we want to improve generally not only U.S.-Russian relations, but also NATO-Russian relations, while making absolutely clear that our commitments to all of our allies in NATO is sacrosanct and that our commitment to Article 5 continues. Finally, we discussed the process that we\\'re putting forward for a strategic concept review.\\xa0 NATO has been so successful that sometimes I think that we forget this was shaped and crafted for a 20th century landscape.\\xa0 We\\'re now well into the 21st century, and that means that we are going to have to constantly renew and revitalize NATO to meet current threats and not just past threats.\\xa0 There has been a process that has been put forward; we are fully supportive of it.\\xa0 I am confident that under Secretary General Rasmussen\\'s leadership that it will ultimately be successful, and that we will continue to see NATO operate in a way that is good for U.S. national security interests, good for our allies, and good for the world. So, Mr. Secretary General, thank you for the excellent work that you\\'re doing and we appreciate it very much.\\xa0 And please feel free to share a few words. SECRETARY GENERAL RASMUSSEN:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your kind words.\\xa0 The President and I have had a very constructive meeting.\\xa0 I have thanked the President for his strong support.\\xa0 I look very much forward to cooperating with the President and his administration on reforming, transforming, and modernizing NATO.\\xa0 We are going to elaborate a new strategic concept, which I hope can serve as leverage for renewal of NATO. Of course, our main focus today has been our cooperation in Afghanistan.\\xa0 I say \"our\" focus deliberately because our operation in Afghanistan is not America\\'s responsibility or burden alone.\\xa0 It is and it will remain a team effort.\\xa0 I agree with President Obama in his approach:\\xa0 strategy first, then resources.\\xa0 The first thing is not numbers.\\xa0 It is to find and fine-tune the right approach to implement the strategy already laid down, and all NATO allies are right now looking at McChrystal\\'s review. I\\'m convinced that success in Afghanistan is achievable and will be achieved.\\xa0 And don\\'t make any mistake -- the normal discussion on the right approach should not be misinterpreted as lack of resolve.\\xa0 This Alliance will stand united and we will stay in Afghanistan as long as it takes to finish our job. As the President mentioned, we have also discussed missile defense.\\xa0 I welcome the new U.S. approach, which will allow all allies to participate, which will protect all allies.\\xa0 And in fact, I think the proposed new system can serve as an instrument to bind all allies -- new and old -- even stronger together. Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Thank you so much.\\xa0 All right, thank you, everybody. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 END\\xa0   12:17 P.M.

BIDEN:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the Parliament, distinguished leaders, friends all, I thank you for this great honor.\\xa0 I do consider it an honor to be given the floor in your Parliament.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tI speak not only on behalf of myself as Vice President, but I speak for my President, President Obama, as well as my country.\\xa0 I come here on behalf of the United States with a simple, straightforward message:\\xa0 We, the United States, stand by you on your journey to a secure, free and democratic, and once again united, Georgia.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tIt’s a journey nearly a century in the making.\\xa0 In May of 1918, the National Council of Georgia -- this very body, under a different name -- declared independence, much as my own nation did 150 years before that.\\xa0 Three years later, you adopted a constitution, a brave declaration of your freedom and independence, even under the imminent threat of an attack.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tOne month later, the Bolshevik occupation was complete, and this parliament met for the last time until the end of the century.\\xa0 It was a journey halted before it began.\\xa0 But the journey renewed in 1989, as the cries for freedom rang throughout Georgia once again, only to be stopped one more time by the last grasp of a dying empire.\\xa0 Two years later, you declared your independence again, and a seed planted generations before became a rose about to bloom.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tGeorgia’s first post-Soviet experiment with democracy was tainted with civil strife, economic hardship, growing corruption, and a backward drift toward undemocratic rule.\\xa0 Then, just six years ago, the Rose Revolution sounded a clarion call for freedom and democracy that was literally heard around the world.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tI still draw inspiration from that moment and the journey you have taken.\\xa0 I remember watching in awe as you stood straight and tall.\\xa0 So did millions of people around the world whose quest for freedom is not yet complete.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tOne year ago, as the Speaker referenced, I came to Georgia under very different circumstances.\\xa0 I was advised by many not to come.\\xa0 I was told that it wasn\\'t a particularly opportune moment.\\xa0 But I wanted to make clear why your independence was so important to my country and the world.\\xa0 Instead of standing in your parliament, I sat on the rooftop of a restaurant with President Saakashvili, as the sound of artillery fire and fighter aircraft punctuated the night.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tOn that rooftop, I pledged America\\'s support to Georgia in my status as the United States Senate.\\xa0 And I here today pledge it again, as Vice President of the United States of America.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 I pledge it not only on my behalf, but on behalf of President Barack Obama.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tThis visit, Tbilisi -- to Tbilisi, comes deliberately right after President Obama’s trip to Moscow, for as he was planning his trip -- (applause) -- as he was planning his trip, he instructed me to plan my trip to Tbilisi.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLadies and gentlemen -- and I know that some are concerned, and I understand it, that our efforts to reset relations with Russia will come at the expense of Georgia.\\xa0 Let me be clear:\\xa0 They have not, they will not, and they cannot.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAs I said in Munich in the first days after our administration was sworn in, and as President Obama, I might add, reasserted two weeks ago in Moscow, we stand by the principle that sovereign democracies have the right to make their own decisions, and choose their own partnerships and their own alliances.\\xa0 We stand against the 19th century notion of spheres of influence.\\xa0 It has no place in the 21st century.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tWe will not -- we will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And we urge -- we urge the world not to recognize them as independent states.\\xa0 And we call upon Russia to honor its international commitments clearly specified in the [ *sic] 12 ceasefire agreement, including withdrawal of all forces to their pre-conflict positions, and ultimately out of Georgia.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAnd we support the expansion of international monitors throughout Georgia to promote peace and stability.\\xa0 During my visit last year, I was moved by the plight of families displaced from their homes in South Ossetia.\\xa0 And I was struck by the effort to undermine your economy by targeting critical infrastructure deep within Georgia.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tI promised that my country would provide meaningful assistance to Georgia to help you recover.\\xa0 And today, I am pleased to say that the United States has delivered on that commitment I made of $1 billion.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLadies and gentlemen, since August, we have provided supplies and shelter to those displaced, budgetary support to help your government meet its fiscal responsibilities, reconstruction aid to help those who were able to return home, and funding for roads and energy security; and new resources to strengthen Georgia’s civil society, legal system and independent media.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAll in all, Georgia today is one of the highest per-capita recipients of U.S. aid in the entire world.\\xa0 Even where I come from, a billion dollars for 5 million people is a lot of money.\\xa0 We are also working closely with Georgia to modernize your military, with a focus on training, planning and organization.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tWe understand that Georgia aspires to join NATO.\\xa0 We fully support that aspiration.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 And, members of Parliament, we will work to help you meet the standards of NATO membership.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tI am pleased that just last month, the U.S. and Georgia launched a Charter on Strategic Partnership.\\xa0 We set an ambitious agenda across four key areas:\\xa0 defense and security; economic trade, and energy cooperation; advancing democracy and the rule of law; and strengthening cultural ties between our countries.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLet me be clear about what our strategic partnership with Georgia is, and what it is not.\\xa0 The United States has no desire to create our own sphere of influence in this region or anywhere else in the world.\\xa0 Our goal is to help build a multi-partner world in which nations make common cause of common concerns.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tThese partnerships are not being built against anyone.\\xa0 They are being built to the benefit of everyone who seeks a more democratic, prosperous and secure world.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tWith Georgia, our partnership involves meeting security challenges -- we are grateful, truly grateful that Georgian soldiers will stand next to our brave Marines in Afghanistan.\\xa0 It includes a commitment to energy security, and we welcome Georgia’s role as a bridge for natural resources flowing from east to west, as it did a thousand years ago.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tIt carries with it -- this cooperation agreement -- a determination to build stronger bonds not only between our governments, but among our people through cultural exchanges, entrepreneurial collaboration, and civil society cooperation.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tOur partnership rests on a foundation of shared democratic ideals.\\xa0 That\\'s what you are about.\\xa0 And we will continue to support your work to fulfill the democratic promise of six years ago.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAs President Saakashvili told Parliament earlier this week -- and we expect that he will keep that commitment -- that there is much more to be done.\\xa0 Your Rose Revolution will only be complete when government is transparent, accountable, and fully participatory; when issues are debated inside this chamber, not only out on the streets; when you fully address key constitutional issues regarding the balance of power between the parliament and the executive branch, and leveling your electoral playing field; when the media is totally independent and professional, providing people the information to make informed decisions, and to hold their government accountable for the decisions it makes; when the courts are free from outside influence and the rule of law is firmly established, and when the transfer of power occurs through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic processes, not on the street.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLadies and gentlemen -- I don\\'t mean to sound instructive -- never tell another person what their political interest is.\\xa0 But I can tell you from experience there is no specific checklist for democracy.\\xa0 But there are significant, concrete steps that need to be taken to deepen any democracy.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tSuccess requires the involvement of everyone in this room, of those who were elected outside this room.\\xa0 It requires every Georgian citizen, regardless of their political affiliation or their ethnicity, to take part in their government.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAnd I especially today call upon the young people of Georgia, the next generation of Georgian leaders, to continue to contribute their ideas, their voices, and their energy to help create a peaceful, stable, democratic and economically prosperous Georgia.\\xa0 Only then -- only then will we see a Georgia that is the home to all its rightful citizens.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tAs difficult as this may be, I encourage you to keep the doors open to the Abkhaz and South Ossetians, so that they know they have other options besides the status quo.\\xa0 Instability or renewed conflict guarantees, in our view, a continuation of the unacceptable status quo, and it would discourage the foreign investment that is so essential to the economic growth and the economic progress you so badly need.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tIt is a sad certainty, but it is true there is no military option to reintegration, only peaceful and prosperous Georgia -- a peaceful and prosperous Georgia that has the prospect of restoring your territorial integrity by showing those in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a Georgia where they can be free and their communities can flourish; where they can enjoy autonomy within a federal system of government, where life can be so much better for them than it is now.\\xa0 Show them the real benefits of your nation’s motto: Strength is in unity.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLadies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen of the Parliament -- divided, Georgia will not complete its journey.\\xa0 United, Georgia can achieve the dreams of your forebears and, maybe more importantly, the hopes of your children.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tI’ll end with a phrase -- a verse from maybe Georgia\\'s most famous poet.\\xa0 When I was in the president\\'s office I asked, \"Who is that portrait of?\"\\xa0 And he then gave me the history lesson on, again, maybe your most famous poet, a poet who inspired the journey of freedom in 1921 -- and continues to provide his voice today.\\xa0 And I want to make sure I get this right.\\xa0 He wrote:\\xa0 \"My heart burns with a holy flame that all my strength I may employ, to serve my people faithfully in sorrow and in joy.\\xa0 O let my people\\'s suffering be branded on my soul I ask, and let my heart, through good and ill, be equal to its task.\"\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tLadies and gentlemen, my President and I, my country, we pray that your hearts are equal to the task.\\xa0 I know they are, and so do you.\\xa0 And thank you so very much for not only inspiring your own people in completing this journey, but for the inspiration you\\'ve provided for tens of millions of people seeking what you now have within your grasp.\\xa0 And it is yours to guarantee.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tWe will stand with you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\n\\t\\t*August\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

EDT\\n\\n\\t\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to say a few words about this week's election in Afghanistan. This was an important step forward in the Afghan people's effort to take control of their future, even as violent extremists are trying to stand in their way.\\n\\n\\t\\tThis election was run by the Afghan people. In fact, it was the first democratic election run by Afghans in over three decades. More than 30 presidential candidates and more than 3,000 provincial council candidates ran for office, including a record number of women. Some 6,000 polling stations were open around the country, and Afghan National Security Forces took the lead in providing security.\\n\\n\\t\\tOver the last few days -- and particularly yesterday -- we've seen acts of violence and intimidation by the Taliban, and there may be more in the days to come. We knew that the Taliban would try to derail this election. Yet even in the face of this brutality, millions of Afghans exercised the right to choose their leaders and determine their own destiny. And as I watched the election, I was struck by their courage in the face of intimidation, and their dignity in the face of disorder.\\n\\n\\t\\tThere is a clear contrast between those who seek to control their future at the ballot box, and those who kill to prevent that from happening. Once again, extremists in Afghanistan have shown themselves willing to murder innocent Muslims -- men, women and children -- to advance their aims. But I believe that the future belongs to those who want to build -- not those who want to destroy. And that is the future that was sought by the Afghans who went to the polls, and the Afghan National Security Forces who protected them.\\n\\n\\t\\tThe United States did not support any candidate in this election. Our only interest was the result fairly, accurately reflecting the will of the Afghan people, and that is what we will continue to support as the votes are counted, and we wait for the official results from the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission and the Electoral Complaints Commission.\\n\\n\\t\\tMeanwhile, we will continue to work with our Afghan partners to strengthen Afghan security, governance, and opportunity. Our goal is clear: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and their extremist allies. That goal will be achieved -- and our troops will be able to come home -- as Afghans continue to strengthen their own capacity, and take responsibility for their own future.\\n\\n\\t\\tOur men and women in uniform are doing an extraordinary job in Afghanistan. So are the civilians who serve by their side. All of them are in our thoughts and prayers, as are their families back home. This is not a challenge that we asked for -- it came to our shores when al Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan. But America, our allies and partners, and above all the Afghan people share a common interest in pursuing security, opportunity, and justice.\\n\\n\\t\\tWe look forward to renewing our partnership with the Afghan people as they move ahead under a new government. I want to again congratulate the Afghanistan people on carrying out this historic election, and wish them a blessed month as they come together to welcome the beginning of Ramadan.\\n\\n\\t\\tThanks very much, everybody.\\n\\n\\t\\tQ What about the hero's welcome in Libya, sir?\\n\\n\\t\\tQ Do you consider Libya a terrorist state, sir?\\n\\n\\t\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I think it was highly objectionable.\\n\\n\\t\\tEND\\n\\t\\t1:41 P.M.

EDT\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Hello, everybody.\\xa0 Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome President Abbas to the Oval Office.\\xa0 We had -- we just completed an extensive conversation, both privately as well as with our delegations, about how we can advance peace in the Middle East and how we can reaffirm some core principles that I think can result in Palestinians and Israelis living side by side in peace and security.\\n\\nAs I've said before, I've been a strong believer in a two-state solution that would provide the Israelis and Palestinians the peace and security that they need.\\xa0 I am very appreciative that President Abbas shares that view.\\xa0 And when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here last week I reiterated to him that the framework that's been provided by the road map is one that can advance the interests of Israel, can advance the interests of the Palestinian people, and can also advance the interests of the United States.\\n\\nWe are a stalwart ally of Israel and it is in our interests to assure that Israel is safe and secure.\\xa0 It is our belief that the best way to achieve that is to create the conditions on the ground and set the stage for a Palestinian state as well.\\xa0 And so what I told Prime Minister Netanyahu was is that each party has obligations under the road map.\\xa0 On the Israeli side those obligations include stopping settlements.\\xa0 They include making sure that there is a viable potential Palestinian state.\\xa0 On the Palestinian side it's going to be important and necessary to continue to take the security steps on the West Bank that President Abbas has already begun to take, working with General Dayton.\\xa0 We've seen great progress in terms of security in the West Bank.\\xa0 Those security steps need to continue because Israel has to have some confidence that security in the West Bank is in place in order for us to advance this process.\\n\\nAnd I also mentioned to President Abbas in a frank exchange that it was very important to continue to make progress in reducing the incitement and anti-Israel sentiments that are sometimes expressed in schools and mosques and in the public square, because all those things are impediments to peace.\\n\\nThe final point that I made was the importance of all countries internationally, but particularly the Arab states, to be supportive of a two-state solution.\\xa0 And we discussed how important it is that the Arab states, building off of some of the recognition of the possibilities of the two-state solution that are contained in the Arab Peace Initiative continue to provide economic support, as well as political support, to President Abbas's efforts as he moves the Palestinian Authority forward, as he continues to initiate the reforms that have taken place, and as he hopefully is going to be able to enter into constructive talks with the Israelis.\\n\\nSo, again, I want to thank President Abbas for his visit and a very constructive conversation.\\xa0 I am confident that we can move this process forward if all the parties are willing to take on the responsibilities and meet the obligations that they've already committed to, and if they keep in mind not just the short-term tactical issues that are involved, but the long-term strategic interests of both the Israelis and the Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security.\\n\\nSo, thank you again, Mr. President.\\n\\nPRESIDENT ABBAS:\\xa0 (As translated)\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President, for receiving us here at the White House.\\xa0 We came here to tell you first of all that we congratulate you for the confidence that was expressed by the American people in electing you President of the United States.\\xa0 And we wish you all success in your mission.\\n\\nMr. President, you referred to the international commitment as we stipulated in the road map.\\xa0 I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm to you that we are fully committed to all of our obligations under the road map, from A to Z.\\xa0 And we believe, like you, Mr. President, that carrying out the obligations of all parties under the road map will be the only way to achieve the durable, comprehensive, and just peace that we need and desire in the Middle East.\\n\\nMr. President, I believe that the entire Arab world and the Islamic world, they are all committed to peace.\\xa0 We've seen that through the Arab League Peace Initiative that simply talks about land for peace as a principle.\\xa0 I believe that if the Israelis would withdraw from all occupied Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese land, the Arab world will be ready to have normal relationships with the state of Israel.\\n\\nOn our part, we are carrying our security and responsibility in the West Bank, and have law and order in that areas under our control because we believe that it is in our interest to have security.\\xa0 It's in the interest of stability in the region.\\xa0 And here I would like to pay tribute and thank you to General Dayton and all those who work with him in helping and supporting and training our security organizations to carry out their duties and responsibilities.\\n\\nMr. President, I believe that time is of the essence.\\xa0 We should capitalize on every minute and every hour in order to move the peace process forward, in order to cement this process, in order to achieve the agreement that would lead to peace.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 We got time for a couple of questions.\\xa0 Julianna.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I'm going to ask you a question about your trip next week to Riyadh.\\xa0 Reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil is a cornerstone of your energy policy.\\xa0 And when you meet with Riyadh's King Abdullah next week, what message will you take to him about U.S. energy policy, oil prices, output quotes, and the like?\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 Well, you know, Saudi Arabia has been an important strategic partner in providing us with our critical energy needs.\\xa0 We appreciate that.\\xa0 It's a commercial relationship as well as a strategic relationship.\\n\\nAnd I don't think that it's in Saudi Arabia's interests or our interests to have a situation in which our economy is dependent, or better yet, is disrupted constantly by huge spikes in energy prices.\\xa0 And it's in nobody's interest, internationally, for us to continue to be so heavily dependent on fossil fuels that we continue to create the greenhouse gases that threaten the planet.\\n\\nSo in those discussions I'll be very honest with King Abdullah, with whom I've developed a good relationship, indicating to him that we're not going to be eliminating our need for oil imports in the immediate future; that's not our goal.\\xa0 What our goal has to be is to advance the clean energy solutions in this country that can strengthen our economy, put people back to work, diversify our energy sources.\\n\\nAnd, you know, interestingly enough, you're seeing the Saudis make significant investments both in their own country and outside of their country in clean energy, as well, because I think they recognize that we've got finite -- we have a finite supply of oil.\\xa0 There are going to be a whole host of countries like China and India that have huge populations, need to develop rapidly.\\n\\nIf everybody is dependent solely on oil as opposed to energy sources like wind and solar, if we are not able to figure out ways to sequester carbon and that would allow us to use coal in a non-polluting way, if we don't diversify our energy sources, then all of us are going to be in trouble.\\xa0 And so I don't think that will be a difficult conversation to have.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Question asked in Arabic.)\\xa0 Mr. President, if Israel keeps declining to accept the two-state solution and to freeze the settlement activities, how the U.S. would intervene in the peace process?\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 We'll, I think it's important not to assume the worst, but to assume the best.\\xa0 And in my conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu I was very clear about the need to stop the settlements; to make sure that we are stopping the building of outposts; to work with the Palestinian Authority in order to alleviate some of the pressures that the Palestinian people are under in terms of travel and commerce, so that we can initiate some of the economic development plans that Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has said are so important on the ground.\\n\\nAnd that conversation only took place last week.\\xa0 I think that we don't have a moment to lose, but I also don't make decisions based on just the conversation that we had last week because obviously Prime Minister Netanyahu has to work through these issues in his own government, in his own coalition, just as President Abbas has a whole host of issues that he has to deal with.\\n\\nBut I'm confident that if Israel looks long term -- looks at its long-term strategic interests, that it will recognize that a two-state solution is in the interests of the Israeli people as well as the Palestinians.\\xa0 And certainly that's how the United States views our long-term strategic interests -- a situation in which the Palestinians can prosper, they can start businesses, they can educate their children, they can send them to college, they can prosper economically.\\xa0 That kind of situation is good for Israel's security.\\xa0 And I am confident that the majority of the Israeli people would see that as well.\\n\\nNow, obviously the Israelis have good reason to be concerned about security, and that's why it's important that we continue to make progress on the security issues that so often end up disrupting peace talks between the two parties.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Previous question translated.)\\xa0 President Abbas, you've met with President Obama, and perhaps you shared some of your ideas about permanent status resolution.\\xa0 What was in these ideas, and what kind of appropriate mechanism that you have discussed to realize them and carry them out?\\n\\nPRESIDENT ABBAS:\\xa0 We have shared some ideas with the President, but all of them basically are embodied in the road map and the Arab League Initiative, without any change, without any modification.\\n\\nRegarding the mechanism to carry it out, of course, there is a mechanism through the Quartet as well as the follow-up committee from the Arab nations.\\xa0 Such a proposal will need to be looked at, studied; then we'll see where to go from here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, do you plan to unveil any part or all of your proposal for Mideast peace when you're speaking in Cairo next week, or is it some other message you intend to deliver?\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 I want to use the occasion to deliver a broader message about how the United States can change for the better its relationship with the Muslim world.\\xa0 That will require, I think, a recognition on both the part of the United States as well as many majority Muslim countries about each other, a better sense of understanding, and I think possibilities to achieve common ground.\\xa0\\n\\nI want to emphasize the importance of Muslim Americans in the United States and the tremendous contributions they make, something that I think oftentimes is missed in some of these discussions.\\xa0 But certainly the issue of Middle East peace is something that is going to need to be addressed.\\xa0 It is a critical factor in the minds of many Arabs in countries throughout the region and beyond the region.\\xa0 And I think that it would be inappropriate for me not to discuss those.\\n\\nI'm not going to give you a preview right now, but it's something that we'll certainly discuss.\\n\\nOne thing that I didn’t mention earlier that I want to say I very much appreciate is that President Abbas I think has been under enormous pressure to bring about some sort of unity government and to negotiate with Hamas.\\xa0 And I am very impressed and appreciative of President Abbas's willingness to steadfastly insist that any unity government would have to recognize the principles that have been laid by the Quartet.\\n\\nIn the absence of a recognition of Israel and a commitment to peace, and a commitment to previous agreements that have already been made, it would be very hard to see any possibility of peace over the long term.\\xa0 And so I want to publicly commend President Abbas for taking that position because I think it's a position that's in the interest of the Palestinian people, in the interests of peace in the region, and it's something that the United States very much agrees with.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Asked in Arabic.)\\xa0 Mr. President, if I may, President Bush hoped that you would have a Palestinian state by the time he leaves office.\\xa0 It didn't happen.\\xa0 Do you have a time frame when this Palestinian state is going to happen?\\xa0 Are you talking about a timetable for negotiation?\\n\\n(Previous question translated.)\\xa0 The first question to President Abbas:\\xa0 Mr. President, did you receive any kind of clear-cut commitments from President Obama, or any pledges that would help you to strengthen your hands when you are dealing with the Palestinian public and opposition among Palestinians that this peace process activities could be viable and could be actually productive?\\n\\nAnd the second question was, did President Obama ask you to have a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu?\\n\\nPRESIDENT ABBAS:\\xa0 President Obama basically talked and reaffirmed the international commitments that we all agreed to, and they are all embodied in the road map.\\xa0 He talked about the necessity to have two states, he talked about the importance of stopping settlement activities, and he also talked about the importance of achieving peace through negotiating all permanent status issues.\\n\\nObviously without discussing and negotiating permanent status issues there will be no progress.\\xa0 We know that all the six issues of permanent status were discussed with the previous Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, and what is needed right now is to resume the discussions with the current Israeli government.\\n\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA:\\xa0 And in terms of a timetable, I have not put forward a specific timetable.\\xa0 But let me just point out, when I was campaigning for this office I said that one of the mistakes I would not make is to wait until the end of my first term, or the end of my second term, before we moved on this issue aggressively.\\xa0 And we've been true to that commitment.\\xa0\\n\\nFrom the first week that I arrived in this office, I insisted that this is a critical issue to deal with, in part because it is in the United States' interest to achieve peace; that the absence of peace between Palestinians and Israelis is a impediment to a whole host of other areas of increased cooperation and more stable security for people in the region, as well as the United States.\\xa0 And so I want to see progress made, and we will work very aggressively to achieve that.\\n\\nI don't want to put an artificial timetable, but I do share President Abbas's feelings and I believe that many Israelis share the same view that time is of the essence, that we can't continue with a drift**, with the increased fear and resentments on both sides, the sense of hopelessness around the situation that we've seen for many years now -- we need to get this thing back on track.\\xa0 And I will do everything I can, and my administration will do everything I can -- my special envoy, George Mitchell, is working as diligently as he can, as is my entire national security team, to make sure that we jumpstart this process and get it moving again.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nEND\\n5:39 P.M.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Patricia, thank you so much for sharing your story, and doing such a wonderful job. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I start with my remarks I want to acknowledge some people who've been working diligently on this issue, in some cases for years. First of all, our Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner is here. Christina Romer, the Chair of -- there she is -- of my Council of Economic Advisers, is here. Senator Danny Akaka from Hawaii; Representative Steve Driehaus of Ohio; Representative Walt Minnick of Idaho; Representative Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania; Representative Al Green of Texas. Karen Mills, our outstanding Administrator of the Small Business Administration; Sheila Bair, who's been doing a heroic job trying to deal with the banking situation as Chairman of the FDIC; Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia; and my National Economic Advisor, Larry Summers. And finally, we've got some special guests, some of the finest attorney generals who are fighting against consumer fraud and have been dealing with some of the consequences of the issues that we're discussing here today -- I'm proud to have them here: My former seatmate in the Illinois State Senate, Attorney General Lisa Madigan; Andrew Cuomo of New York; Martha Coakley of Massachusetts; and Roy Cooper of North Carolina. Please give them all a big round of applause. (Applause.) Now, for the last several months, this administration has been working with Congress to reform an outdated system of financial regulations and lax oversight that helped lead to last year's crisis. And I want to thank some people here who are working tirelessly on this issue -- first of all, Chairman Chris Dodd of the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Barney Frank of the House Financial Services Committee, Richard Shelby, also of the Senate Banking Committee -- for the leadership and enthusiasm that they have shown throughout this process. Part of our reform effort involves putting in place new safeguards that would help prevent the irresponsibility and recklessness of a few from wreaking havoc on our entire financial system. We want to close gaps in regulation; we want to eliminate overlap; and we want to set rules of the road for Wall Street that make fair dealing and honest competition the only way for financial firms to win and prosper. But a central part of our reform effort is also aimed at protecting Americans who buy financial products and services every day -- from mortgages to credit cards. It's true that the crisis we faced was caused in part by people who took on too much debt and took out loans they couldn't afford. But my concern are the millions of Americans who behaved responsibly and yet still found themselves in jeopardy because of the predatory practices of some in the financial industry. These are folks who signed contracts they didn't always understand offered by lenders who didn't always tell the truth. They were lured in by promises of low payments, and never made aware of the fine print and hidden fees. Secretary Geithner and I just finished meeting with some of these Americans who've joined us here today. And you've already heard from Patricia, who was forced to pay thousands of dollars in interest on a $550 payday loan. And we also had a chance to hear from Susan Chapman, who had excellent payment history until she was contacted by a broker who told her that she could lower the monthly payments on her mortgage. Instead, the loan they sold her ended up increasing her debt, and her principal has now gone up $20,000. We talked to Karen Cappuccio, who is still fending off foreclosure because her mortgage company duped her into taking out two expensive loans when they had originally promised her one low, fixed-rate mortgage. We talked to Maxine Given, whose bank hit her with four separate overdraft charges because of one mortgage check that they ended up rejecting the very next day. And I should add, by the way, that this is a CPA that we're talking to here. So if it's happening to her, if it's happening to Maxine, then imagine what the rest of us who can barely add are dealing with here. We talked to Andrew Giordano, whose bank made a mistake that cost him $800 in overdraft fees. And when he caught their mistake, the bank only refunded part of the fees. As we've seen over the last year, abuses like these don't just jeopardize the financial well-being of individual Americans -- they can threaten the stability of the entire economy. And yet, the patchwork system of regulations we have now has failed to prevent these abuses. With seven different federal agencies each having a role, there's too little accountability, there are too many loopholes, and no single agency whose sole job it is to stand up for people like Patricia, Susan, Maxine, Andrew and Karen -- no one whose chief responsibility it is to stand up for the American consumer, and for responsible banks and financial institutions who are having to compete against folks who are not responsible. So under the reforms we've proposed, that will change. The new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that I've asked Congress to create will have just one mission: to look out for the financial interests of ordinary Americans. It will be charged with setting clear rules of the road for consumers and banks, and it will be able to enforce those rules across the board. This agency will have the power to make certain that consumers get information that is clear and concise -- in plain language -- so they can compare products and know exactly what they're getting themselves into. It will ensure that banks and other firms can't hide behind these ridiculously confusing contracts -- pages and pages of fine print that nobody can figure out. It will have the ability to enforce and build on the credit card reforms we passed earlier this year, so that consumers aren't hit with unfair rate hikes and penalties, or hidden charges. It will require brokers to look out for the interests of families if they give advice about mortgages. And it will ensure transparency and fair dealing for other financial products, like bank overdraft services and payday loans. In a financial system that's never been more complicated, it has never been more important to have a watchdog function like the one we've proposed. And yet, predictably, a lot of the banks and big financial firms don't like the idea of a consumer agency very much. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions on an ad campaign to kill it. You might have seen some of these ads -- the ones that claim that local butchers and other small businesses somehow will be harmed by this agency. This is, of course, completely false -- and we've made clear that only businesses that offer financial services would be affected by this agency. I don't know how many of your butchers are offering financial services. (Laughter.) Contrary to what some have argued, this agency would not restrict consumer choice and innovation. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the past, a lack of clear rules led to innovation of the wrong kind: The firms that did best were the ones who did the best job of hiding the real cost to consumers. We don't want them competing by figuring out how much they can fool ordinary Americans. By contrast, the consumer agency we're proposing would set ground rules so that firms don't have to compete to confuse families, but they have to compete to give them better choices. This will also help small business entrepreneurs who often rely on credit cards and home equity loans to finance their start-up businesses. All this hasn't stopped the big financial firms and their lobbyists from mobilizing against change. They're doing what they always do -- descending on Congress, using every bit of influence they have to maintain the status quo that has maximized their profits at the expense of American consumers, despite the fact that recently a whole bunch of those same American consumers bailed them out as a consequence of the bad decisions that they made. And since they're worried they may not be able to kill this agency, they're trying their hardest to weaken it -- by asking for exemptions from this agency's rules and enforcement; by fighting to keep every gap and loophole they can find. They're very good at this, because that's how business has been done in Washington for a very long time. In fact, over the last 10 years, the Chamber alone spent nearly half a billion dollars on lobbying -- half a billion dollars. The stories we heard today, they remind us that the American people can't afford business as usual any longer. These Americans can't afford high-priced lobbyists to argue their case. They're counting on us to be their advocates, to be their voice, to restore a sense of responsibility from Wall Street to Washington. That's why we need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will stand up not for big banks, not for financial firms, but for hardworking Americans. (Applause.) That's why we need regulatory reform that will reward innovation and competition instead of short-cuts and abuses. That's why we can't let special interests win this fight. We've already seen and lived the consequences of what happens when there's too little accountability on Wall Street and too little protection for Main Street, and I will not allow this country to go back there. It is time for us to move forward. It is time for real change. And I'm confident that we're going to get it done, with the help of all the people who are here today, and, most importantly, with the help of the American people, who are going to demand a better deal from their financial services. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END   2:49 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\",\n",

CST\\nMRS. OBAMA: Goodness. Wow. (Applause.) Well, this is -- I\\'m thrilled. You know, you all have been standing in the heat. (Applause.) Now, that\\'s love. (Applause.) But I am just thrilled to be here.\\nFirst, let me begin by thanking a few people -- your general, General Davis, for his kind introduction but also for his leadership. I want to thank not just the general but his wife, Susan, because we always have to remember the women behind the men, or the spouses behind the leaders. (Applause.)\\nIn addition to the general and Susan, I want to thank Colonel McClintock and his wife, Tammy. I want to thank Chief Master Sergeant Thomas Westermeyer and the Commander Chief of the Air Armament Center, and his wife Diane. I want to thank Colonel Bill* McMullen, Vice-commander of the First Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field for their outstanding leadership. (Applause.)\\nThe President and I are grateful for your service. We are grateful. And I know that folks at Eglin and Hurlburt are grateful for your dedication and your commitment and your leadership. I have had a wonderful opportunity to sit down with the commanders and with folks leading the Family Readiness Unit, and working in child care. And I\\'ve learned such a great deal about the community that you all are building here. It is a model for the nation, and it was an honor for me to be here and to talk with all of you.\\nI also want to acknowledge Vicki Miller, the wife of Congressman Jeff Miller, who\\'s taken the time to be here to greet me. Although her husband is voting back in Washington, she has been a dear friend and supporter. Vicki, where are you? Give a wave. (Applause.) Thanks for being here, Vicki. (Applause.)\\nAnd thanks also to the many elected and community leaders who are here. I met many of them earlier today. And I want to thank all of them for the support of our men and women in uniform. You can do a lot in a base community, but the community that a base is in extends far and wide, and it takes the mayors, the non-elected officials, the community service leaders, the folks embracing you all. And the folks here are blessed to have a very strong community, and I want to give them a round of applause as well. (Applause.)\\nI also want to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Rob Lyman, who isn\\'t here because he\\'s currently at work in the U.S. Department of Transportation. He is one of 15 people chosen out of 1,000 applicants to be a White House Fellow. You should be very proud. That\\'s a tough program to get into, and he is there representing you well -- (applause) -- and I want to thank you all for loaning him to us for this short period of time.\\nI know firsthand just how extraordinary the people are that come from Eglin. And I know firsthand because we have somebody who works very closely with our family, Major Jeff Keuter, who would be very embarrassed that I\\'m even mentioning his name. He was here at Eglin for three years, and he is now our family\\'s physician. So Major Keuter takes excellent care of me and the President and the girls. They even chip in when Bo needs a hand. (Laughter.) And I would like to ask him to stand up so he can -- there he is over there, very embarrassed. (Applause.) We are very proud of him. He keeps us healthy.\\nI\\'d also like to say a personal word of thanks to the 728th Air Control Squadron –- the Demons –- (applause) -- who just returned home last month from Iraq and Qatar -– the unit\\'s sixth deployment since 2003. Welcome home. We\\'re proud of you. (Applause.)\\nLook, I know so many of you -- these folks, the Demons and so many people protect my husband and Vice President Biden when they travel, so they have a special place in my heart for sure, and I want to give them a thanks on behalf of the Obamas and the Bidens. You guys are terrific, and we are grateful to you.\\nNow, as somebody, as you know, who cares very much about military families, I was very pleased to hear that the Air Force leaders designated this year the \"Year of the Air Force Family.\" And that\\'s very -- a very -- (applause) -- important statement to make. And I was even more pleased when General Schwartz said the year would be devoted both to highlighting what\\'s working for families, and also figuring out what isn\\'t working for families, so that we can take the steps to fix it.\\nBecause that\\'s actually a pretty good description of what I\\'ve been trying to do for the past few years as I visit our troops and their families all across the country. My dear friend, Dr. Jill Biden, the Vice President\\'s wife, and I have been asking questions, we\\'ve been listening –- trying to get feedback on what\\'s going on, what models work, what models don\\'t -- and we\\'re working to make sure that your voices are heard in Washington and that we can figure out how to raise up best practices and make sure that our efforts in Washington are trickling down to the folks who matter most -- and that\\'s our servicemen and women and their families.\\nAnd visiting with servicemembers and their families is truly one of the greatest things that I do as First Lady. It\\'s one of my greatest privileges because I always come away from these visits with a renewed sense of pride, and gratitude, and a sense of awe -- truly a sense of awe.\\nI stood in a line and heard story after story of your colleagues that\\'s been deployed for most of their time as servicemembers; their stories of bravery, how they left their families, how they dealt with fire, how they continued to recover -- and each and every one of them are ready to do more. So I\\'m in awe of the courage, the patriotism and the commitment to excellence that our men and women in uniform display every single day.\\nIt\\'s a commitment I see every time that my family steps aboard Air Force One or on Marine One, or interacts with any of the members of our military that oversee operations at the White House. My husband and I say this all the time: The training that you receive is the best. And you come out so whole and ready for so much that you don\\'t even know -- and it makes us proud of the military.\\nI\\'m in awe of the sacrifices that you make -– a small fraction of our population bearing such a huge burden for eight years of war -- I\\'m in awe -- serving tour after tour of duty, missing out on birthdays, and anniversaries, and soccer games, moments with people that you love the most. I\\'m in awe. I\\'m in awe of every single one of you.\\nBut I\\'m also in awe of the loved ones here, the people who have your back. I know that service doesn\\'t end with the person wearing the uniform -- and you all know that -- and war doesn\\'t end when servicemen and women come home. I know that our troops\\' sacrifices are their families\\' sacrifices too.\\nI have met spouses who play the roles of both parents, trying to keep the household together, making their children feel like everything is okay, juggling play dates and lessons and soccer games, trying to hide fears and worries, trying to calm nerves, and doing their best to answer all those questions that both the mother and father should answer -- but they\\'re handling it alone, and they\\'re doing it with grace.\\nI have met grandparents, and aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, who step in to care for children when there\\'s a single mom or dad that\\'s in uniform and they\\'re deployed.\\nAnd I have met families who are caring for wounded warriors, those whose brave loved ones have given the ultimate sacrifice. I\\'ve met all those people.\\nAnd the thing that always strikes me isn\\'t just that there are hardly ever complainers in these groups –- even when that would be understandable. And it isn\\'t just that they\\'re not asking for any kind of special treatment ever -- even when the most -- most of them would certainly deserve some special treatment.\\nBut I\\'m struck by how, at a time when they\\'re making the greatest sacrifice of all, when they\\'re already stretched so thin in their own lives, they somehow find time to reach out a hand and help somebody else. That is always the story. I am struck by how even with all they\\'ve got going on, they somehow find a way to do even more and to give back to the communities that they\\'re in. This is the constant message that I get from these visits.\\nAnd that is certainly the case here at Eglin and at Hurlburt. I\\'ve heard those stories. You all are involved in everything from Relay to Life, to the Boy Scouts, to Toys-for-Tots. You\\'re volunteering in your local churches and your schools, and even more.\\nIn fact, I\\'m told that one of the youth programs in this community gets about half of its volunteer coaches from troops staffed here at Eglin. Half of their volunteers come from you all. And I hear that you\\'ve taken on the challenge -- the Combined Federal Campaign -- with a vengeance, donating whatever you can to help others.\\nSo I think it\\'s pretty clear that our men and women in uniform and their families have more than done their duty to this nation.\\nSo I think it now falls upon us, as a grateful nation, to do ours in return. It\\'s our turn to look out for you. So that\\'s why my husband\\'s budget includes a few things -- like pay raises for men and women in uniform -- (applause); additional permanent forces to reduce the stress of long deployments; support for military spouse career development -- (applause) -- that\\'s something that we hear; improved military housing, yay -- (applause); and financial assistance to military families who\\'ve had to sell their homes during the housing crisis and are facing losses. (Applause.)\\nAnd we\\'ve heard from military families that there were some additional steps that could be taken so that military families can more fully benefit from the Family and Medical Leave Act.\\nSo Congress has been working to extend federal family leave protection to the family members of our regular active duty personnel so that they can take time off from work to be with their servicemember for deployment-related activities or to attend important family responsibilities.\\nAnd I am so pleased that Senator Chris Dodd is working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to extend federal family leave protection to the family members of injured veterans. If enacted, this legislation will help more military families address the unique issues they face in balancing work and family.\\nBut providing our military and their families with the support they\\'ve earned requires more than just good government; it requires an active citizen as well. Let\\'s never forget that when our troops go off to war, they\\'re protecting every single one of us. And the freedoms that they fight for are ones that every single one of us as Americans enjoy. And that\\'s why I\\'ve made it a personal priority to ask all Americans to do their part to show our appreciation. (Applause.)\\nAnd the community that you\\'re in right now, as I said earlier, is a shining example of how that can be done -- from throwing barbecues and the shrimp boil -- that I didn\\'t get invited to, but that\\'s okay -- (laughter); to donating facilities for community events; to showing appreciation with gifts at the holidays; from a 13-year-old girl who started Hero Hugs to send cards and care packages to servicemembers abroad; to an 84-year-old woman who\\'s spent 43 years volunteering at Eglin hospital. You all know how important it is to support our men and women in uniform, and we thank you for that.\\nBut the thing is, not every community has a military base, as you know. Not every community is as blessed as Eglin is. We\\'ve got National Guard and Reserve families in cities and towns all across the country. We\\'ve got wounded warriors working hard to recover, and families struggling to cope with the loss of the person that they loved most in the world.\\nSo I encourage everyone in this country to reach out through your schools, to reach out through your churches and your workplaces to find out if there are servicemembers or military families nearby who can use a hand. Just look around in your own community. And it can be something as simple -- you know what your Family Readiness support groups do -- it\\'s something simple as offering babysitting, or handling carpool duty, or giving a stressed mom a break; bringing over a meal. It doesn\\'t really take that much.\\nIf you own a business, think about making an effort to hire a military spouse or a veteran with that open position when you get one. If you have a professional skill, whether you\\'re a lawyer, or an accountant, or a mental health professional, you can offer services to our military families pro bono.\\nAt the very least, each of us can do one simple thing -- and that is to take the time to say thank you. Just take the time to say thank you. Thank you for the sacrifices that you are all making on behalf of this nation. And we can thank you all for all that you do to serve our communities, every last one of you.\\nAnd today, I\\'m thinking of one particular example that I heard about here at Eglin –- the clothing drive a group of Airmen started to help children they\\'d met in an orphanage in Grenada while they were supporting my husband\\'s trip to the Summit of the Americas. Before they knew it, so many donations had poured in that they had to end the drive. That\\'s because everybody here stepped up. It took two entire days just to sort out what they had received.\\nIt\\'s a perfect illustration of the spirit of our military and our military families. It\\'s what makes our armed forces the best in the world -- (applause) -- and not just because of your courage in the face of adversity, or your heroism on the battlefield, but your compassion, and your decency, and your generosity.\\nSee, that is the face of America that the world gets to see. They see this country through your eyes as well -- through your good deeds. And in doing so, you make us so proud, so very proud.\\nSo I know times get hard. I know that. There is no way that I can know intimately how hard it can be, but I am committed as First Lady to spend every ounce of my platform trying to make sure that the country never forgets; that they don\\'t forget our servicemembers and they certainly don\\'t forget those that are left here to keep it together. (Applause.)\\nSo know that you\\'re not alone. Know that there are so many people who are sending their prayers and their appreciation and their gratitude. When I travel around the world, people talk about our military. They talk about how you represent the world, and they talk about how it is a duty of all of us to make sure that we honor the work that you do. So thank you.\\nAnd now let\\'s get out of this heat. (Laughter and applause.)\\nEND \\n4:20 P.M. CST\\n\\n',\n",

CDT   THE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Folks, before I begin my formal remarks, since I have that bad reputation of telling it straight, I want to tell you something.\\xa0 I always feel good when I got the UAW behind me, in front of me, to my right and to my left.\\xa0 I wouldn\\'t be in office without you all.\\xa0 (Applause.)   And now, thank you so much, Charlie.\\xa0 Look, the truth is I come from a state that was a UAW state.\\xa0 We\\'re in tough shape, my UAW, my Chrysler local, my GM local.\\xa0 We\\'re in deep trouble.\\xa0 We may not -- many of my guys and women may not survive this transitional automobile industry.\\xa0 But you know the standard that the President and I have used in terms of what constitutes recovery in this economy is not merely whether or not the economy grows again.\\xa0 It will grow again.\\xa0 We will lead again.\\xa0 But what we will not consider a success is if we grow and we lead again, but the middle class does not grow with that growth.\\xa0 (Applause.)   Ladies and gentlemen, the UAW and the union movement have built the middle class of America.\\xa0 But from 19 -- from 2001 to 2008, productivity in America grew by 20 percent, but the old bargain had been broken:\\xa0 Middle-class households actually lost several thousand dollars over that -- that 10 -- that eight years.   So, folks, the measure for us is, for those aspiring to and those in the middle class, when we grow out of this economic doldrum we\\'re in, if we don\\'t raise the standard of living for you all, then we haven\\'t succeeded.\\xa0   And ladies and gentlemen, you can still lead a decent life.\\xa0 You can still live in a good neighborhood.\\xa0 You can still have dreams for your kids.\\xa0 You can still be able to afford all the basic necessities if you have a decent wage and a decent job.\\xa0 And that\\'s what we\\'re about -- trying to preserve those.   I want to thank you all.\\xa0 I want to thank the management here who has been steadfast, innovative and, quite frankly, is part of the future; understands what kind of platform we have to build for a new economy in the 21st century.   I also want to thank former governor -- you can tell he was a former governor, he\\'s so sure -- Secretary of Commerce Locke, for helping lead our country in a new era of innovation and progress.\\xa0   Folks, it\\'s not that this can\\'t be done.\\xa0 This can be done.\\xa0 The first thing I started this morning was with President Obama.\\xa0 We started in what they call the Executive Office Building, making an announcement for what will amount to more than a $15 billion investment in -- what, $13 billion investment in high-speed rail -- good jobs, an economic future that understands our energy needs and how to save it and how to connect this country in a way.   And some people say it can\\'t be done.\\xa0 The Gov knows it could be done.\\xa0 My friend from over 30 years, Ike, knows.\\xa0 All you got to do is go to France or China and get on a train and you\\'ll go up to 300 miles an hour.\\xa0 And they say it can\\'t be done in America?   Well, ladies and gentlemen, the President says there\\'s nothing in the world we cannot do.\\xa0 We have the best workforce, we have the best people, we have the greatest ingenuity of any nation on Earth.\\xa0   And ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Locke -- and he referred to the Secretary of Energy, the new guy -- not a whole lot of Nobel Laureates in physics who are Secretaries of anything -- this guy is the real deal, the Secretary of Energy; he\\'s a Nobel Laureate.\\xa0 Science is back, folks, in the White House.\\xa0 And we\\'re going to do -- is we\\'re going to help, with your help, transform this country.   You know, as I walked around the plant and got a cook\\'s tour of what you\\'re doing and how you\\'re doing it, it\\'s clear you\\'re going to help grow our economy.\\xa0 But I know as I walked around the plant today that what I saw was the future -- was the future.\\xa0 You guys are just right here at the beginning, you\\'re in the ground floor -- the ground floor of what could be the economic engine that not only gets us out of this doldrum we\\'re in, but literally, literally propels this nation to be able to lead the world in the 21st century the same way we did in the 20th century.\\xa0   I\\'ll tell you what I saw.\\xa0 I saw what I\\'m used to seeing at every UAW factory I go into.\\xa0 I saw hard-working people who are smart as heck, knew what they were doing, and took pride -- took pride in what they do.\\xa0 I saw you filling good jobs, creating not just transformers, but building a sturdy platform for the new economy of the 21st century, a new economy that\\'s going to be built by the 643 of you here at ABB -- not just making transformers, but the many thousands more like you all around the country that will make, for example, 8,000 different parts that it takes to create a single wind turbine -- and by the millions around the country, assembling a better economic future for everybody.   As you heard, because of the investments from the Recovery Act -- and you all, we use these terms like the Recovery Act.\\xa0 That\\'s where Barack Obama went to the Congress and did something no one has ever done before.\\xa0 He said, I need another $787 billion now -- now -- to go out now and invest in this economy, save jobs, to create jobs.\\xa0 We\\'re not going to wait.\\xa0 We\\'re not going to wait.\\xa0 Too many of your brothers and sisters are really in hard times.\\xa0   And so we did something amidst -- in the midst of an economic downturn that had never been done before.\\xa0 And then he made a big mistake.\\xa0 He said, Biden, you\\'re in charge.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 And I\\'m proud to be in charge of how this money is going to be spent, and whether or not we spend it in an unusual way -- completely transparent for all the world to see; completely accountable so we answer for what we\\'ve done, and efficiently.\\xa0   And ladies and gentlemen, you heard about this act, but let me tell how it works.   You have maintained jobs here because an outfit called Lost Creek Ridge Wind Farm, which was ready to put on hold its projects, was able, through this Recovery Act, to get the money to make its project happen.   We tried to do our part.\\xa0 One of the things they have been able to do is complicated stuff you all understand.\\xa0 It\\'s almost boring, but it\\'s important to understand, as they say, connect the dots, like the Secretary of Commerce connected the dots about why a Smart Grid is so consequential for people.   Ladies and gentlemen, we put in a tax system of financial incentive.\\xa0 It\\'s called a production tax credit.\\xa0 It sounds awful fancy, which may not sound particularly helpful or innovative, but don\\'t let that fool you.\\xa0 It invests about $14 billion -- $14 billion -- in precisely the kinds of projects that you\\'re undertaking here -- exactly the same spirit, the same spirit we know that venture capitalists, those private investors, who put their weight behind projects and hoped to get a big return in. Those folks now are awful hesitant to invest their money, because they don\\'t think much is happening in the economy right now.\\xa0 So we stepped in.\\xa0 We came up with an innovative way to say, okay, we\\'re going to get companies like this windmill company to be able to move forward.   So our Recovery Plan not only provides direct money, but also provides key incentives, too.\\xa0 The Department of Energy has allocated $6 billion to underwrite, to guarantee, in effect, the ability to get investments up to $60 billion, it will generate, in loans for renewable energy projects, just like the one you\\'re going to be a part of making sure gets built here.\\xa0 These guarantees give folks the confidence that they need to make a safer bet on a greener future.   So now with those efforts we\\'ve spurred the state\\'s largest wind energy development, generating roughly -- electricity just in this one project.\\xa0 This is just one example around the nation to generate enough electricity to power at least 50,000 homes.\\xa0 Clean energy, clean energy.\\xa0 Renewable energy -- not needed to be imported.\\xa0 No one has to do anything except the wind blow.   Because the Lost Creek project is a go, there are around 100 wind turbines supplied by GE, and so are the transformers for ABB needed to bring that all to life.\\xa0 So the dots get connected, folks.\\xa0 It matters.\\xa0 It matters for your job.\\xa0 It matters for our future.\\xa0 It matters for my kids and my grandkids.\\xa0   This, in a nutshell, is a story of the Recovery Act.\\xa0 Every way we can use the money to leverage other money being invested in good projects, to directly spur on the kind of investment every one of you know we need.\\xa0 Talk to your brothers and sisters in the automobile industry.\\xa0 I\\'m going to say something that maybe I shouldn\\'t say.\\xa0 You guys made the product, but the design you were given wasn\\'t the one you came up with.   So ladies and gentlemen, we got to get smarter, and that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing.\\xa0 And this is a story of ABB Incorporated and Lost Creek Wind Ridge Farm.\\xa0 This is a story of how the new economy that\\'s predicated on innovation and efficiency is going to inspire the kind of growth we need.\\xa0 This is a story that we\\'re going to write together, you and me.\\xa0 We\\'re going to write this story together.   On the signs around this plant you say you\\'re making transformers.\\xa0 But ladies and gentlemen, there\\'s so much more here than meets the eye.\\xa0 We\\'ve heard for years that a greener economy will benefit and prevent the gridlock that existed; that it will put our grandkids in a position that they will inherit a better planet.\\xa0 True, but that\\'s not the whole story.\\xa0   Barack and I are not waiting for our grandkids.\\xa0 We\\'ve got real live people like you sitting in front of us and standing in front of us, who right now -- right now -- need to be able to use your innovation, energy and skill to be able to make a decent living and to help build this country like every generation of workers has done.\\xa0 That\\'s the reason this country is strong.\\xa0 We spend this great economic power we have.   So we\\'re building a green economy for us, as well.\\xa0 It will increase the bottom lines of businesses and individuals through greater efficiency; lower gas prices by reducing our dependence on foreign oil; return America to our rightful place as the leading edge of progress in the world.\\xa0   Think about it.\\xa0 When you were growing up, did a single one of you think America wasn\\'t the leading nation in the world?\\xa0 I mean, did it even cross your mind that that would be in question?\\xa0 Well, ladies and gentlemen, it\\'s not going to be if we and you have anything to do with it.   So that\\'s what we\\'re doing here.\\xa0 And this is what Secretary Locke and I are doing here.\\xa0 We\\'re seeing first-hand the people whose sweat and fingerprints will be all over this new economy.\\xa0 This new economy is not going to be built by Wall Street and investors; it\\'s going to be built by you, like every single solitary era in our history has been built by the workers who create the productivity and give us the muscle and strength to be the nation we\\'ve always been.\\xa0   And our commitment to you doesn\\'t end with making sure wind farms can continue to go into production.\\xa0 I\\'m happy to announce today the Department of Energy plans to distribute nearly $3.4 billion -- $3.4 billion -- in Smart Grid technology development grants.\\xa0 Your management here, and all of you, you are in the business of being able to compete for those.\\xa0 This is jobs -- jobs.\\xa0   In addition, there\\'s $615 million for Smart Grid storage, monitoring and technology viability.\\xa0 Talking with your management and talking with you guys; that\\'s all within your wheelhouse.\\xa0 My brother has an expression.\\xa0 He said, \"That\\'s in your wheelhouse, Joe.\"\\xa0 It\\'s all in your wheelhouse.\\xa0 You all have the capacity to do the things we\\'re dreaming about you being able to do.\\xa0   Just as Secretary Locke was discussing earlier, a true, smart and resilient electrical grid is necessary to ending America\\'s reliance on foreign oil.\\xa0 How many think we\\'d have so many troops stationed in that area of the world if we didn\\'t need the oil?\\xa0 You know, if you add the actual price of oil, it\\'s probably $10 more a barrel just by the military we have to provide to be able to ensure those oil lanes stay open among other things.   Ladies and gentlemen, it\\'s also -- it\\'s also necessary -- it\\'s necessary to ensuring the delivery of renewable sources of energy to consumers across this country.\\xa0 And it\\'s necessary to be creating the jobs that are not going to be able to be exportable, that will pay a living wage, a decent wage, and allow people in the middle class to sustain their standard of living and see it grow, and have a promise for their kids.   You know, when I was growing up in Scranton, even though my dad lost his job and told us we had to move -- like a lot of you probably experienced -- my dad never doubted for a second that things would come back.\\xa0 I was raised in a neighborhood like some of you closer to my age who said -- when your parents said, look, you can do anything you want to do as long as you work hard, as long as you are honest, as long as you do the right thing, as long as you support your country -- and we believed it.\\xa0 And we did it.\\xa0 But how many parents feel the certainty of being able to say that to their kids right now, because they see things blow up in their face through no fault of their own.   Well, ladies and gentlemen, one of the ways to ensure that future again is to get in front of the technical -- technological revolution that is necessary to sustain and make this world survive; and that\\'s a new green economy, particularly as it relates to energy.   These necessary upgrades are going to allow us to modernize our electrical grid, improve its efficiency and reliability while stimulating local economies while saving consumers\\' money.\\xa0 And right here in Missouri, the Lost Creek Wind Project will be designed with Smart Grid components in mind.\\xa0 That\\'s what the next piece of this puzzle is.   All components will be connected through a high-speed communications, and monitored through a system that provides real-time production data from that wind farm.\\xa0 This is what allows renewable energy sources like wind to be effectively and efficiently integrated into the electrical grid, and allows us to take wind from the Midwest and power urban areas all across the country.\\xa0 We have vast renewable resources in this country that are untapped; wind is only one example.\\xa0 But to take advantage of it, you\\'ve got to bring the power to where the people are, and that depends on a bigger, smarter grid and that\\'s what we\\'re starting -- this is the base of what we\\'re developing here.   In the end you ask for bringing much more efficiency into our energy production.\\xa0 But as we do it, we\\'ll also be creating jobs, non-exportable jobs, good-paying jobs, not just any jobs.\\xa0 We\\'ll be leaving men and women like you with the ability to have jobs that can\\'t be exported which are going to be the foundation for a new economy -- jobs you can keep forever.   It was a President from Missouri named Harry Truman who faced a similar uncertainty at the end of World War II.\\xa0 When he became President he said, and I quote, \"May we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage.\\xa0 In that way, America may lead the world to peace and prosperity.\"\\xa0 We are the world\\'s hope to lead it to peace and prosperity as Truman\\'s generation did.\\xa0 His words are as true today and the optimism should be as real today as it was after 12 million men and women came home after having been in arms.   Hard workers like you are the core -- the core -- literally the core of that glorious heritage.\\xa0 And together we\\'re going to once again lead the world in peace and prosperity.\\xa0 And it starts by building a foundation, a foundation for a new economy.\\xa0 And it\\'s going to be built on your shoulders, on your ingenuity, and your hard work.\\xa0 I promise you that.\\xa0 I promise you that.   So, folks, next time I come back I hope I see 1,244, and then 2,050.\\xa0 I hope I see all over America -- all over America, by the time our term ends, real live good-paying jobs with companies making real profits, once again leading the world.   We\\'re counting on you.\\xa0 And I hope you know you can count on us.\\xa0 Thanks for what you do.\\xa0 May God bless you.\\xa0 May God protect our troops.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 (Applause.)

EDT   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 MRS. OBAMA:\\xa0 Well, that's hard to follow.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 I mean, those were just some amazing presentations.\\xa0 Carlos, Cierra, Tammy, David, I am so proud of you all -- I mean, because it wasn't just what they said, but how you presented it, how you structured it; you added humor, great description.\\xa0 Just as a teacher, that's just A-plus work right there.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it says it all.\\xa0 I mean, those presentations are just a great representation of what this little project can do with kids.\\xa0 They just eat up information and they take our lead, and they drink it up like nothing, and then they turn it around and teach us in the process. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It has been an honor to work with you all.\\xa0 It has been an honor.\\xa0 Each and every time you have come to the White House, you have come with graciousness, good manners, enthusiasm, energy.\\xa0 Your parents should be very proud of you, as well as your teachers.\\xa0 You have made it just so easy for us to work with you, and I am thrilled to be here in your garden.\\xa0 And I'm going to do some planting, too, here. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I want to thank you all for what you've done to help us get the garden started.\\xa0 And Tammy, just to answer your questions, the garden is beautiful.\\xa0 It is blooming, it is bursting.\\xa0 We've already used about 80 pounds of lettuce.\\xa0 We've eaten it, we served it at a big fancy luncheon that I did for other congressional and senate spouses, and they just raved over it.\\xa0 And I told everybody about the work that you did to plant it, how you came back again and again, and how you're working in your own gardens. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So everything is going well.\\xa0 We also shared some of the lettuce and some of the honey with Miriam's Kitchen, as well, so already the work that you're doing is not just feeding our family and the staff and our guests at the White House, but it's feeding people who may not have anything to eat.\\xa0 So you all should know, when you come back to harvest in a couple of weeks, you will see a totally different garden.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Everything is blooming.\\xa0 We even had to replant some more lettuce because we used it up so quickly.\\xa0 But the beans are starting to sprout up.\\xa0 We put the tomatoes in.\\xa0 We've sent -- rhubarb.\\xa0 We've had rhubarb pie.\\xa0 If you guys have had rhubarb, it tastes just -- sort of like strawberry, and maybe Sam -- Mr. Sam -- (laughter) -- maybe we can do something with rhubarb, a nice sweet when you guys come back for the harvesting. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And we used a lot of the herbs, seasonings in our salads and in our foods, so we are using every single aspect of that garden.\\xa0 And the tomatoes, hopefully, will be starting to come up, and some of the berries, as well. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So things are going well at the White House Garden, thanks to you all, and you should be proud of what you've done.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But this is exactly why I wanted to be a part of this project -- what we're seeing here.\\xa0 Being able to share this with the Bancroft School has just been a special treat because as the students indicated in their presentation, it's not just about being out in the garden, being out in the open air, or being at the White House.\\xa0 They've really learned some lessons about nutrition.\\xa0 They're making different choices because they're a part of the process of planting and tilling the soil and pulling up the food.\\xa0 It makes such a huge difference in the choices that they make. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So this is an example of why we wanted to do this, and I'm so happy that today some parents and community members have been able to join us to see just how much these kids have learned and how much they've embraced these concepts, because it's an example of what we can do nationally with kids and nutrition, because we have to have these conversations about nutrition in a society where we're seeing growing rates of obesity and diabetes among kids.\\xa0 It is really about choices. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And one of the ways that I got involved in gardening and eating fresh foods is because I was a busy parent.\\xa0 When we started this election, even before this campaign, you find that your schedule is so packed that it becomes difficult to figure out how to quickly and effectively feed your family.\\xa0 So what do you resort to?\\xa0 I know, it was take-out, it was processed foods, it was everything quick and easy.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And we started to see that taking a toll on our health.\\xa0 And our children's pediatrician gave me a little tap on the shoulder and said, you might want to make some changes.\\xa0 And the changes that we made were very simple.\\xa0 We added more fruits and vegetables to our plates.\\xa0 We eliminated processed foods.\\xa0 We didn't say no to anything -- we still went out -- but it was just about moderation, and we were able to engage our children in the process of understanding what foods do to their bodies. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And like the kids at Bancroft, they ate up that information and they started schooling me and lecturing me about what I should be eating, and what a carrot does, and what broccoli does.\\xa0 And sometimes they look at my plate in disgust now.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 But what that just told me is that kids can lead the way for us, because we care about them so much.\\xa0 I know I care about these kids as much as I care about my own.\\xa0 And I wanted to share some of the lessons that I learned as a parent and the improvement that I saw in our overall family health with the rest of the nation, because it is difficult if you don't know about choices. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And we also know that access and affordability is also an important part of this conversation, which is why encouraging people to use farmer's markets, community gardens are really critical.\\xa0 But we have to figure out how to make this more affordable.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And Bancroft School, this partnership has been right on track, because you've seen firsthand how possible it is to develop a community garden.\\xa0 There were times, my mother reminded me, when there were victory gardens all over communities throughout this nation.\\xa0 She talked about, as we went through this garden project -- it was like -- she just remembered that her mother -- you know, they had seven kids -- would get their fruits and vegetables from a victory garden in their neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago.\\xa0 And that was one of the reasons why during some tough times with a big family and very little resources, they always had fruits and vegetables.\\xa0 That was always something that was a part of their diet.\\xa0 So part of what we need to do is reengage our communities in this kind of dialogue.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we also need to think more broadly about the quality of the foods that we give our kids throughout -- what we're doing in our schools, in our school lunch programs -- because as the economy gets more troubled, there are going to be more and more kids who are going to qualify and rely on the meals that they get at schools, their breakfasts and their lunches. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And the next step -- or one of the next steps in this conversation is figuring out how do we ensure, through the help of the government, as well as local communities, that the foods that our kids are getting in school each and every day is as healthy as it can be, so that we're bringing some of these lessons home and we're also expanding them in the classrooms and in the schools. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So this has been just a wonderful kickoff.\\xa0 And as you said, you think I've -- you've enjoyed the hugs and the kisses and the hugs and the sharing?\\xa0 I've enjoyed that the most --\\xa0 getting to know you guys, digging in the dirt, you know, just being out in the open air and watching your excitement -- because we did a lot of hard work moving that dirt with those shovels.\\xa0 That was harder than I thought it was.\\xa0 Remember we had to get the soil ready?\\xa0 That was hard.\\xa0 That stuff was heavy, wasn't it? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 AUDIENCE:\\xa0 Yes. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 MRS. OBAMA:\\xa0 But you guys didn't stop.\\xa0 And I didn't think that we were going to finish planting everything.\\xa0 I told Sam -- I said, well, we're going to -- when it was time to plant, I said, well, maybe we'll get through some of this, but we're going to run out of time.\\xa0 But what did we do?\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 AUDIENCE:\\xa0 Finish. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 MRS. OBAMA:\\xa0 You finished everything.\\xa0 You guys planted every single thing in the White House Kitchen Garden.\\xa0 You did everything, and you didn't stop until it was done.\\xa0 And you should be proud of yourselves because I am so proud of you.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you for being you guys, okay.\\xa0 So let's go out and do some more planting.\\xa0 (Applause.) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 END\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2:23 P.M.

EDT\\n\\n\\t\\tTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good afternoon.\\xa0 Before I comment on today’s meeting in Geneva, I want to say a few words about the recent tragic events in the Pacific.\\n\\n\\t\\tOn behalf of the American people, I want to once again extend my deepest condolences to the people of American Samoa and Samoa for the terrible loss of life and the devastation that took place after the recent earthquake and tsunami. I’ve spoken to the governor and delegate from American Samoa, and we continue to provide the full support of the federal government for relief efforts there.\\xa0 I have also directed the State Department to provide the assistance necessary to help Samoa recover as well.\\n\\n\\t\\tWe’re also deeply moved by the suffering and loss of life that’s been caused by the recent earthquake in West Sumatra.\\xa0 And my administration has been in touch with the government of Indonesia to make it clear that the United States stands ready to help in this time of need, and I’ve ordered my administration to coordinate with the ongoing relief and recovery efforts there.\\n\\n\\t\\tIndonesia is an extraordinary country that’s known extraordinary hardship from natural disasters.\\xa0 I know firsthand that the Indonesian people are strong and resilient and have the spirit to overcome this enormous challenge. And as they do, they need to know that America will be their friend and partner.\\n\\n\\t\\tToday, in Geneva, the United States –- along with our fellow permanent members of the UN Security Council -– namely, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom, as well as Germany -– held talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\n\\n\\t\\tThese meetings came after several months of intense diplomatic effort.\\xa0 Upon taking office, I made it clear that the United States was prepared to join our P5-plus-1 partners as a full participant in talks with Iran.\\xa0 I extended the offer of meaningful engagement to the Iranian government.\\xa0 I committed the United States to a comprehensive effort to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear power –- provided that they live up to their international obligations.\\n\\n\\t\\tAnd we have engaged in intensive bilateral and multilateral diplomacy with our P5-plus-1 partners -- and with nations around the world –- to reinforce this point, including an historic U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed unanimously last week.\\n\\n\\t\\tThe result is clear:\\xa0 The P5-plus-1 is united, and we have an international community that has reaffirmed its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.\\xa0 That’s why the Iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in Geneva:\\xa0 Iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with regard to its nuclear program.\\n\\n\\t\\tIn pursuit of that goal, today’s meeting was a constructive beginning, but it must be followed by constructive action by the Iranian government.\\n\\n\\t\\tFirst, Iran must demonstrate its commitment to transparency. Earlier this month, we presented clear evidence that Iran has been building a covert nuclear facility in Qom.\\xa0 Since Iran has now agreed to cooperate fully and immediately with the International Atomic Energy Agency, it must grant unfettered access to IAEA inspectors within two weeks.\\xa0 I’ve been in close touch with the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, who will be traveling to Tehran in the days ahead.\\xa0 He has my full support, and the Iranian government must grant the IAEA full access to the site in Qom.\\n\\n\\t\\tSecond, Iran must take concrete steps to build confidence that its nuclear program will serve peaceful purposes -- steps that meet Iran’s obligations under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.\\xa0 The IAEA proposal that was agreed to in principle today with regard to the Tehran research reactor is a confidence-building step that is consistent with that objective -– provided that it transfers Iran’s low enriched uranium to a third country for fuel fabrication.\\xa0 As I’ve said before, we support Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear power.\\xa0 Taking the step of transferring its low enriched uranium to a third country would be a step towards building confidence that Iran’s program is in fact peaceful.\\n\\n\\t\\tGoing forward, we expect to see swift action.\\xa0 We’re committed to serious and meaningful engagement.\\xa0 But we’re not interested in talking for the sake of talking.\\xa0 If Iran does not take steps in the near future to live up to its obligations, then the United States will not continue to negotiate indefinitely, and we are prepared to move towards increased pressure.\\xa0 If Iran takes concrete steps and lives up to its obligations, there is a path towards a better relationship with the United States, increased integration with the international community, and a better future for all Iranians.\\n\\n\\t\\tSo let me reiterate:\\xa0 This is a constructive beginning, but hard work lies ahead.\\xa0 We’ve entered a phase of intensive international negotiations.\\xa0 And talk is no substitute for action.\\xa0 Pledges of cooperation must be fulfilled.\\xa0 We have made it clear that we will do our part to engage the Iranian government on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect, but our patience is not unlimited.\\n\\n\\t\\tThis is not about singling out Iran.\\xa0 This is not about creating double standards.\\xa0 This is about the global non-proliferation regime, and Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear energy, just as all nations have it -- but with that right, comes responsibilities.\\n\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\tThe burden of meeting these responsibilities lies with the Iranian government, and they are now the ones that need to make that choice.\\n\\n\\t\\tThank you very much.\\n\\n\\t\\tEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\t\\t3:29 P.M.
